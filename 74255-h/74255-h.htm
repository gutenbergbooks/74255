PREFACE.
</p>

<p>
This story is for the most part a romantic rendering
of a very obscure episode in the story of the reign
of Charles the Second.  It does not pretend to more
historical accuracy than belongs to other romances
which are spun from a thread of fact on a spool of
fiction, but it may be mentioned that the scenes and
the actors are mostly real, and it should be remembered
that the story of the Rye-house Plot (1683) as
told in authentic records is strangely vague.  That
there was a plot&mdash;that the King's house at Newmarket
was burnt, or at least that part of it containing the
royal apartments was on fire&mdash;and that Charles
escaped, are the certain points of the story.  The
details are left very much to imagination, and as
fancy is free, "one story is good till another is told."

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
"QUEEN RUTH."
</h3>

<p>
May-day!  None of your raw, drizzling,
windy, nineteenth-century May-days,
when folks, chilled to their marrow-bones,
draw their old cloaks and coats
about them and beg for a cozy blaze in place of
the smart new "ornament for the fire-stove."
No; a right-down, unmistakable, fine old English
first of May, with a fine old English sun,
gradually assuming roseate hues, and setting the
heavens in a glow as he slopes westward behind
the trees of Epping Forest, casting long shadows
athwart the smooth-shaven grass-plot which
carpets the forecourt of a fine old many-gabled
Hertfordshire farm-house; while his dying
brilliancy gilds the broken summits of the ruined
gate-house overshadowing it, and illumines the
fresh tints of the cowslips, and earliest summer
flower-garlands, festooned with many a gay ribbon-knot
about a May-pole towering to the cloudless
sky.  Around this a group of young folks are
merrily footing it to the tune of "Phillida flouts
me," which the fifers and fiddlers, mounted on a
table beneath the big spreading yew-tree, are
braying out with a will.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Spring-tide.
</span>
</p>

<p>
And the Queen of the May?  Well, there she
is; that&mdash;.  But no; what differs more than
taste on these points? and you must decide for
yourself concerning the value of her claims on
beauty.  To you it may seem that many of those
bright eyes, and laughing lips, and all the rest of
it, rival the charms of Queen Ruth, Young
Mistress Ruth Rumbold, the only child of Master
Richard Rumbold of the Rye House, whose
embattled gate-tower roof just shows yonder through
the trees, with its gilded vane gleaming in the
setting sun-rays.  But then you do not know
Ruth as all these good people have known her for
fifteen years turned last Martlemas-tide, when she
was left a motherless three months old babe to
the care of Nurse Maudlin&mdash;Maudlin Sweetapple.
Therefore it is hardly possible for you to conceive
how entirely she has won the affection, even of
creatures commonly reported to be destitute of it;
such as Gammer Grip, the miserly old hunks who
lives in the tumble-down hut over against the
crossways, and of Growler and Grab, the Nether
Hall watch-dogs and terrors of the neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The maltster's daughter.
</span>
</p>

<p>
So possibly it has come to pass, that love has
clothed little Mistress Ruth about with a beauty
strangers might not be able to see.  For you, the
gray eyes so frankly meeting yours from
beneath their long dark lashes and the well-defined
brows might be too grave and thoughtful, though
indeed, quite to decide, you should wait till she
speaks.  The tip of that little nose, to please your
classical notions, ought not possibly to assert its
right of way as it does, in just the slightest of
upward directions.  Neither is her mouth of the
"button-hole" or "two-cherries-on-one-stalk"
order; though it is a handsome, sweet-tempered
mouth enough, with its resolute yet mobile curves
when the red lips part to speak or to smile.
Then again, her hair is neither sunny nor raven-black,
as it behoves heroines' hair to be; but then
she did not look to be a heroine, this Hertfordshire
maltster's daughter.  Nor was it of the
tawny red the fine ladies of those Merry Monarch
days delighted to dye their locks; but just of an
ordinary middling shade of brown, with the faint
ripple of a natural curl on her white forehead, and
something of the sort which defied the silken
snood, and saucily insisted on straying at
pleasure about the nape of her slender neck.  As to
her hands, they were as well moulded and serviceable
a little pair as you might wish to see; and if
they were a trifle browner than modish maidens
might have considered altogether the thing, the
sun, and the churn, and the delicious home-made
bread, and such like things, were possibly responsible;
but an ocean of milk of roses itself, could
not have been so soft and sweet as their touch, if
you needed help from them in any pain or trouble
befalling you.
</p>

<p>
Doubtless as pretty a pair of feet as hers were
to be found in the shire; but if Cinderella's own
were smaller&mdash;IF they were&mdash;they could not
have been prettier; and let her wear what she
might, those partial people who knew her, declared
that Ruth Rumbold's clothes always became her.
Be that as it may, very certain it is that that
kirtle of flowered chintz looped above the
pink-and-white striped tiffany petticoat marvellously
becomes her trim figure, and matches bravely
with the red and snow white hawthorn wreath
crowning her shapely head; and never, declare
her loving lieges, was fairer Queen of May than
this Queen Ruth.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The master of Nether Hall.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Her Majesty's partner in the dance now being
so spiritedly carried on, is the lord of those
May-day revels, Lawrence Lee, the young master of
the Nether Hall farm.  The natural order of the
festivities would assign him the distinction; but
in this particular instance it is no empty one.
Left to his choosing, he would in every
probability have invited Ruth, queen or no queen, to
dance with him, for the two were fast friends;
and such they had been since first Madam Lee,
Lawrence's mother, had gone with her own
five-year-old boy toddling beside her, across the fields
to the Rye House; and there, taking the motherless
baby Ruth in her kind arms, she had tenderly
kissed the winsome face; and the little boy saw
with wondering awe how some tears were left
shining, bright as dewdrops on daisy flowers, upon
the placid sleeping eyelids as she laid the little
creature down again in its cradle.  "We must
love her dearly, for she has no mother," murmured
Madam Lee; and so faithfully had Lawrence
backed up her proposition from that day forward,
that his affection had gone on growing with his
own inches; and if he loved Ruth when he
paddled, a barefooted urchin, along with the ducks
about the reedy shallows of the moat, inveigling
her to the like unlawful courses, she was every
whit as dear to him now that he stood a good
five feet eleven in his buff boots.
</p>

<p>
As handsome a young fellow as you were likely
to meet on a long summer day's journey, with
his lithe figure, dark eyes, and crisp locks, was
this young master, now in fact and in right, of
the Nether Hall farm and its broad acres, since
he became turned of twenty-one last Shrovetide,
as for quite two years before he had been to all
intents and purposes; for his farming genius was
inborn, and he was never happier than when he
was busy among his barns and his hayfields.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A secret.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Possibly Lawrence Lee carries his liking for
hard work so far, that holiday-making bores him.
At all events, let him succeed as he may in cheating
his guests generally into admiration of his high
spirits, his efforts at gaiety are so exaggerated and
fitful that Ruth is not for an instant to be imposed
upon by them.  And when at last the dance is
done, and the syllabub is being handed round,
and the two stroll away into the hornbeam maze,
which brings you, if you are acquainted with its
mysteries, to the field-path leading straight to the
river's brink, the good folks would stare to
see&mdash;or can it be the leafy shadows which so heavily
darken those two young faces?  Nay; the shadows
are from within, as if black care were busy at
their hearts.  Yet with a difference; for while
Lawrence's brow is brooding and abstracted, Ruth's
eyes are full of wistful anxiety; and with her little
hand tight in his clasp the two silently thread the
maze, until suddenly the fiddles and fifes strike up
afresh; and this time their tune is "Begone Dull
Care."
</p>

<p>
"Let us go back," said Lawrence, breaking
from his moody silence into a laugh of forced
merriment, "and enjoy ourselves while we can.
Come, Ruth, one more dance," and he seized her
by both hands.
</p>

<p>
"No," she answered.  "I must go, Lawrence;
and at once.  It will be almost dark now before I
am home, and father will be angry."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
On the River Lea.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Lee's brow fell again; but he only said, "As
you will;" and they walked on till they reached
the river's brink, where a small boat, newly
painted, and decked with ribbon-tied cowslip and
daisy posies, lay moored to a stout stake.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence's customary mode of transplanting
Ruth from dry land to his little craft, was to catch
her light figure in his stalwart arms and seat her
in the stern "before she knew where she was," as
she would say with terrific frowns.  To-night,
however, he soberly&mdash;did she fancy it was even a
trifle absently?&mdash;assisted her in with his right
hand.  That this new order of things had not
escaped her notice, some look in her face made
him uncomfortably conscious.
</p>

<p>
"Is your majesty well placed?" he asked,
affecting to laugh as he took the sculls and
paddled out into mid-stream.
</p>

<p>
"We should be so," she replied with mock
gravity, drawing up the rudder cords.  "Thanks
to your lordship's ceremony in seating us."
</p>

<p>
"That," returned he, breaking into a smile of
unfeigned amusement at her lofty air, "is no more
than what is due to your majesty's supreme rank
from your majesty's most loyal subject."
</p>

<p>
"We find that good hearing," said Queen Ruth,
"since we are convinced that my Lord Lawrence
Lee always feels in his heart what his speech
professes."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A troubled heart.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Her words were jestingly uttered; but the
young man bit his lip hard; and his cheek grew
white, as if some sharp sudden pain had stung
him.
</p>

<p>
"Lawrence!" cried Ruth, starting and bending
forward, "what is the matter?  You are ill."
</p>

<p>
"Not I, dear heart," replied he, sweeping one
hand hurriedly across his face.
</p>

<p>
"You are so pale," she insisted.
</p>

<p>
"Tired," laconically said he, vigorously plying
his oars.  "With that last measure, you know,"
he added in explanatory tones, as she opened her
eyes rather contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
"For my part," she said, "I am not so delicate,
and could have danced on till daylight again.
Though in that case, 'tis clear, I should have had
to be beholden to another partner," she added,
with saucy composure.
</p>

<p>
"Not while I had a leg to stand on," briskly
returned he.  "But the fact is&mdash;well, I must be
getting old, eh Ruth?"
</p>

<p>
"A whole quarter of a century.  In four years
more," interrupted she, with a ringing laugh.
</p>

<p>
"And that is ever so far on towards the half of
a lifetime," he murmured thoughtfully to himself,
"even supposing one is let live it through in
peace.  Well," he added, in a louder key, "'tis
certain age brings a peck of cares, Ruth."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me some of yours," said she coaxingly,
"so that I may share the burden of them.  Shall
I not?" she pleaded on in gentle earnest tones.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven forbid!" fervently ejaculated the young
man.  "Heaven forbid you should ever do that,
child!  There must come never a cloud to darken
little Ruth's days."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Cross-purposes.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"And yet I think mine can scarce be all sunshine
if yours are&mdash;mind! mind!  There you go!
Running right into the mudbank!"
</p>

<p>
"Then must my steerswoman be to blame,"
laughed he.  "Pull to the right, Ruth."
</p>

<p>
"I hate secrets," she pouted, doing as he directed.
</p>

<p>
"There are some things," rejoined the superior
creature, "girls can't understand."
</p>

<p>
"Then, to be sure, I think they cannot be good
for boys&mdash;we crave your lordship's pardon&mdash;MEN
we should have said;" and Ruth hemmed a
little correcting cough&mdash;"to meddle with;
And&mdash;  There you are again.  All in the osier tangle
now!"
</p>

<p>
"Confound it! and whose fault but yours?" he
cried petulantly.  "Didn't I bid you keep to the
right?"
</p>

<p>
"And how am I to see what I'm doing, pray,
if you will bob your head about in that fashion?"
retorted she, irately knitting her brows.  "Lawrence,
dear, what's your mighty secret?" she added,
in honey-sweet tones.
</p>

<p>
"Who said I had one?" flashed he.  "How
stupid and disagreeable you are to-night, Ruth!
What is it you want?"
</p>

<p>
"Only for you to be nice again.  Dear, nice,
happy, old Lawrence."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Stillness but not peace.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Nice! happy! psha! bah! hang it!  A fellow's
nowhere with you girls if he isn't always up in
the seventh heaven!" grunted Lawrence, and then
he rowed on in sulky silence between the
low-lying meadow banks, where the quiet oxen
stood plunged knee-deep in the fresh young
buttercup-studded grass, lazily sniffing in the
fragrant evening air, all translucent with the
greenish golden tints of mingled young moon-beams,
and the last rays of the setting sun.  Save
the low chirp, chirp, twee of the birds settling to
their nests among the pollard willows, and the
ripple of the water about the boat's prow, not a
sound broke the stillness, till a somewhat sharp
bend of the river brought them in sight of a
wooden bridge, overshadowed to its right by a
thicket of tall beeches and brushwood; while
leftwards, a narrow road threaded on across it to
a second bridge, spanning another stream that
gleamed gray and still as glass between straight
high-lying banks scarcely twenty yards beyond;
and so winding on, over a waste of level common
land, till it was lost in distance.
</p>

<p>
Dimly discernible through the copse to the
right of the first bridge were the walls of a
quaintly-timbered, many-gabled, two-storied
house, whose latticed casements and trellised porch
gleamed in the night's soft radiance; whilst a huge
sign, bearing the royal arms, swung in its carved
oaken framework, which projected from between
the windows of the upper storey, right across the
narrow road above the lofty wall of red brick
which ran facing the inn for some distance.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Master Rumbold on the watch
</span>
</p>

<p>
Close down on a tiny landing-stage, by the
nearer bridge's foot, a man stood watching the
approach of the boat with his one available eye.
The other, blurred and blemished apparently past
all service, aggravated the naturally stern and
sinister expression of features passable and even
handsome, to which his puritanical pot-hat,
leathern-belted, black, close-fitting doublet and
plain white linen collar lent no relief.  Neither
did the knitting of his sombre brows relax, but
rather gathered more heavily, as Lee made fast
the boat and Ruth sprang lightly to the bank.

CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
HOW A MYSTERIOUS COAL BARGE CAME TO THE "KING'S ARMS."
</h3>

<p>
"You are late, girl," he said gloomily.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, father," answered Ruth, glancing
from his face towards the still
brilliant westward horizon.  "'Tis
not yet seven o'clock."
</p>

<p>
"Tush!" he rejoined impatiently.  "I'll have
no more of these gaddings.  And hark you, young
mistress, no more of these vanities neither;" and
he looked as he spoke, in angry contempt at her
dainty skirts.  "In with you at once and lay
them away.  Or better still, cast them into the
kitchen fire.  And as for this," he went on, roughly
clutching at her hawthorn wreath, and dragging
it from her head, he flung it into the water, "Let
that settle it."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A gloomy end to May-day.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Tears of grief and indignation sparkled into
Ruth's eyes, as she watched the beautiful flowers
whirled by the eddying tide into deep water; but
by a strong effort she restrained herself, and only
said in tones of gentle reproach, "'Twas my
crown, father.  They made me Queen of May."
</p>

<p>
"Queen! crown! forsooth! did they so?" he
said, with a bitter smile.  "How is it the very
stones do not cry out against this restoring in
our unhappy country of these mummings and
pagan holidays?  Is it not enough to be having
queens&mdash;ay, and kings&mdash;of flesh and blood
wantoning it at Whitehall, but we must be seeing
modest maidens aping their antics, and behaving
in this fashion?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, Master Rumbold," said Lee, "our people
desired to do Ruth an honour; and I think you
should be proud."
</p>

<p>
"I should be prouder," returned Rumbold,
turning irefully on the young man, "to see her in
her winding-sheet, a pale white&mdash;Marry! and let
me look at your face now, Mistress," he went on,
snatching her roughly by the chin.  "Ha! red as
your gaudy flowers there!  So!  I guessed as
much.  And there has been romping, has there?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, father; just a little turn or two at
Hoodman Blind, and Hunt the Slipper."
</p>

<p>
"What next?" said Rumbold groaningly, and
turning up his eye.
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;and a measure," faltered the truthful Ruth.
</p>

<p>
"Dancing!" and now the stern eye glared.
</p>

<p>
"Only round&mdash;round the Maypole, father."
</p>

<p>
Rumbold's lips parted with a jerk, as if he was
about to break into still sharper rebuke; but as
his eye caught the expression of Lawrence's face
he contented himself with reiterating his dismissal.
</p>

<p>
"Good night, father," said Ruth, lifting her
face to his, but Rumbold did not, or affected not
to see.  He was standing absorbed in watching the
approach of a big black coal-laden barge which
now hove lumbering in sight through the middle
span of the bridge.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The queen's crown goes down.
</span>
</p>

<p>
As the boat cleared into open stream again her
huge black bows came athwart the poor drowning
May garland, and swirled it deep down under water.
</p>

<p>
Whether the unfortunate wreath's destruction
afforded Rumbold special pleasure, or that some
other cause originated the grim smile slowly
breaking on his gloomy lips, who shall say?  The
look at all events roused Lee's ire, and he said in
tones of indignant reproach, which he seemed at
small pains to conceal, "Your daughter bids you
good-night, Master Rumbold."
</p>

<p>
The maltster started from his abstraction, and
imprinting a cold kiss on Ruth's upturned brow,
waved her away with a gesture of impatience, and
resumed his contemplation of the barge.
</p>

<p>
Now, in Ruth's eyes coal-laden barges were
things as ugly almost as they were common up
and down their little silver Lea; and the rapt
interest her father appeared to be taking in this
one and particular specimen of its class, attracted
her wonder and curiosity.
</p>

<p>
To her the boat seemed only more than a
usually hideous one, by reason of its cruel
destruction of her May crown; and partly in search
of sympathy, partly in good-night, she stole a
glance at Lawrence Lee.  Alack!  He had seemingly
forgotten her very existence, so absorbed
was he also in following the course of the barge.
"And this," thought Ruth, swallowing back a
rising lump in her throat, was "the end of the
delightfullest day she had ever spent!"  Truly, as
once she had read somewhere in some dusty fusty
old book, "a merry going out makes a mournful
coming in," and she turned with lagging and
sorrowful step up the grassy slope, pausing,
however, within a few yards of the road, which was
fringed with a thick growth of bracken and
bramble, to cast one more wistful glance at
Lawrence, and to see whether the odious barge had
taken itself out of sight.
</p>

<p>
Nothing of the sort.  There stood the young
man with folded arms, and brows gloomily knit,
watching the boat, which was now turning from
midstream.  A minute more, and it floated up
to a standstill alongside of the water steps, near
the bottom of the inn garden.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mysterious visitors.
</span>
</p>

<p>
The willow boughs interlace and hang so
heavily over the white wooden paling which
skirts the garden by the water's edge, and cast
such bewildering shadows in the now fast gathering
darkness, that Ruth cannot be certain of the
precise number of figures all wearing
broad-brimmed slouch hats and long black cloaks,
which rise, as she looks, from the depths of the
barge, and springing in hot haste to the bank, as
quickly disappear in the direction of the inn
yard.
</p>

<p>
Two&mdash;three&mdash;five&mdash;seven, and Ruth, despite
her chagrins, was beginning to smile at the
vision she has conjured up of Mistress Sheppard's
face when she should see this concourse of
barge-men, coal-heavers, or whatever they might be,
besieging her kitchen door.  "A scurvy lot,
quotha!" could not Ruth hear her grumbling
over it all as plain as if she really spoke?  "A
scurvy lot!  Each of them, of course, looking
for his cup of her home-brewed cider for their
invaluable aid of landing a few coals."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the lean, thread-paper body of
Mistress Sheppard's husband showed among the
gooseberry bushes, describing, as it neared the
steps, the acute angles which always marked his
fashion of welcoming distinguished guests to his
hostelry.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Strange cargo.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Here!" at the same moment said a voice
from the barge in low tones, but of which every
syllable was audible to Ruth through the utter
silence around.  "Lend a hand, can't you?" and
then rose up another figure, habited like the rest,
but with the folds of his mantle flung far back
over his shoulders, leaving his arms free to
encompass a load covered with a large piece of
tarry canvas.  This man's burden, judging by his
swaying gait, must have been of no light weight,
"They're not feathers," he growled, as he laboured
with it to the broad top of the barge's sides.
</p>

<p>
"All right!" eagerly said the voice of Rumbold
as he advanced to the steps.  "Come along in,
quick, Colonel.  We'll unload presently."
</p>

<p>
"That's as you please," returned the other.
"But by your leave we'll be having these under
cover at once.  They were tempered Venice way;
and your own pretty daughter wouldn't get so
much harm from the night dews, as they would.
By the by,&mdash;little Mistress Ruth, she is safe
indoors and abed?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay," sullenly grunted Rumbold.  "That's my
affair, I doubt, Colonel Rumsey."
</p>

<p>
"No offence," returned the other.  "I just
ventured to ask the question, because I had a
notion that I caught a glimpse of young Farmer
Lee's brown jerkin among the yew trunks yonder
as we were clearing the bridge."
</p>

<p>
"And what if you did?  Isn't he one of us?"
said the maltster, casting a careless glance round.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A startling accident.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"True," answered Rumsey, in rather lagging
tones.  "He's a necessary evil, as you explained,
for the use his premises may be to us; but I'd as
lief he'd been out of the bargain if't had been
possible.  He's but a stripling; and old heads are
the only ones for our sort of work, depend upon't.
There's what one may call a kind of touch-and-go
slipperiness"&mdash;  The rest of what the speaker
might be having to say was lost in a deafening
clash of steel, while he himself disappeared
totally from Ruth's range of sight, in what seemed
a flash of blue lightning.
</p>

<p>
"Lookye, Colonel!" said Rumbold, when, after
a brief interval, he had succeeded, with Master
Sheppard's aid, in hauling Rumsey to his feet
again and landing him safe on the top of the
steps.  "Half an inch more and you'd have been
under water."
</p>

<p>
"'Twas those confounded nettles," growled
the discomfited Rumsey, rubbing himself all over,
and glaring vindictively behind him at the dank
weed tangle all crushed into greenish mud under
his heavy weight, while Rumbold and Sheppard
busied themselves in hastily collecting the
scattered contents of the fallen load.  "Have you got
them all?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay," answered Rumbold.  "Come along,
Colonel.  They're waiting for us."
</p>

<p>
"There were twelve," said Rumsey.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, we can make another search presently,"
impatiently returned Rumbold.  "There's
no fear.  The place hereabouts is haunted, the
credulous yokels will tell you; and they'd sooner
die than set foot in it after nightfall.  So come.
Have with you, Master Sheppard."
</p>

<p>
And followed by Sheppard the two walked
towards the house.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Lawrence Lee hesitates.
</span>
</p>

<p>
And Lawrence?  What has been his share in
this unexpected scene?  Hardly that of an
amazed spectator, Ruth thinks, while she watches
the hurried, half-stealthy nod of recognition
bestowed on him by the new-comer, as the three
men pass within a few yards of the spot where he
is standing.  Gloomily the young man returns
their greeting, but he remains motionless as
any stone statue, making no attempt to join
them; and when they have disappeared he casts
a wistful glance at his own little craft, where she
lies moored in a fall flood of moonlight, and
sighing so heavily that Ruth can hear the sound of it
ever so distinctly in the silence, for not so much
as a leaf is stirring now Then he turns, and,
taking the narrow footpath leading to the front
porch of the inn, is lost in its shadows.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The postern gate.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Ruth rose from her hiding-place, listening
intently.  All quiet at last; and gathering the
tiffany skirts close about her, she sped like a
lapwing through the brushwood towards a little
postern-gate in the red wall, and tapped at it
softly.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
MAUDLIN SWEETAPPLE.
</h3>

<p>
"Marry! and so here you be at last,
child!" said a half-glad, half-chiding,
cracked, treble voice, as a brown
withered hand unfastened the door
from within.  "Have you seen your father?"
</p>

<p>
"Let me come in, Maudlin, dear.  Quick!"
was all Ruth's response as she hurriedly slipped
inside; and then, carefully closing the postern,
she seized Maudlin by the elbow, and dragged
her along the gravel path till they stood under a
groined arch, in whose recesses two stout
nail-studded oaken doors faced each other.
</p>

<p>
Pushing open the one to the right, which stood
ajar and yielded at once to her touch, Ruth lifted
a curtain of tapestry hanging on its inner side,
and entered a spacious oak-wainscoted chamber,
whose handsome but old-fashioned and well-worn
furniture showed dimly in the light of the log-fire
burning on the hearth.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said, at last answering the old
woman's question.  "He was down by the bridge."
</p>

<p>
"That's well," said Maudlin, heaving a sigh of
relief, as she sank into a big comfortable armed
chair beside the hearth, "for he seemed main put
about that you tarried so late.  Tho', as I said to
him: 'Tis but once in our lives we're young,
Master Rumbold,' I said.  And have you had a
good time of it, dear heart?  Marry! you've been
as blithe as a cricket, I'll warrant; and Master Lee,
did he row thee along home in his boat, lady-bird?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course he did," replied Ruth, stooping
down over the hearth, and busying herself with
mending the fire with the stray bits of
smouldering log.
</p>

<p>
"Of course he did," mimicked Maudlin, her
little bead-black eyes twinkling merrily.  "Marry,
come up!  Hark at that now!  And left Madam
Lee, poor lady, to entertain her company as she
might!  That's what comes o being Queen o' May.
Heigho!  When douce King Jamie, as his own
Scots folk used to call him, sat on his gold throne,"
went on Maudlin, spreading her withered hands
out in the brightening blaze and looking hard
into it, "they made May Queen o' me.  Well,
well, and Master Lawrence is gone home again
now&mdash;eh, child?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Ruth, with a slight start.  "Oh,
yes&mdash;I mean no&mdash;I mean&mdash;that is, how should I know?"
</p>

<p>
"How should you know?" echoed Maudlin testily;
"because you've got eyes and ears, I
suppose.  Is the child gone silly?"
</p>

<p>
"It's you're silly," retorted Ruth crossly,
"asking such stupid questions;" and then she, too, set
to staring moodily into the fire.
</p>

<p>
"Fretty!" inwardly commented the old nurse,
as she stole a cornerwise glance at Ruth's pale
face.  "Fretty as any teazle burr.  And 'tisn't once
in a six month she's that, poor dear.  Tired out;
that's what 'tis.  As tired out, I'll warrant, with
her bit o' pleasurin' as ever our old Dobbin is
with his plough work, and as ready as he is for
his feed o'&mdash;What'll you like for supper, lady-bird?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing."
</p>

<p>
"Eh, naught's a sorry supper indeed.  Naught?
when there's syllabub sweet as your own Colley's
milk can make it; and the hot-spiced cake"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Ah! how you do plague!  I'm not a bit hungry.
It's been eat, eat, eat, all day down at the
Hall," said Ruth, still half cross, and yet half
apologizing for her most unusual shortcoming.
</p>

<p>
"Madam Lee is main an' hospitable, to be sure,"
said Maudlin, "and likes folks, rich and poor, to
be havin' their fill.  God bless her!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay," nodded Ruth, and a faint smile of pleasure
flitted across her grave face.
</p>

<p>
"And poor old Maudlin," slyly went on the old
nurse, "would a'most be finding it in her heart to
be jealous of her, if she wasn't quite sure&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Only she is," smiled Ruth, turning and twining
her arms round her friend's neck.  Then she
drew down the old face, as brown and shrivelled
as any russet apple, and kissed it.  "She knows
that I love her best in all the wide, wide world."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, for sure.  Does she now?" contentedly
laughed the old woman.  "Well, well, Maudlin'll
do to count with maybe.  But this junketing's
done thee no good, Ruth," she went on, considering
the upturned face with real anxiety.  "You're
pale as pale, child."
</p>

<p>
"Tired just a bit," answered Ruth, again striving
to evade Maudlin's gaze.  "Maudlin, dear,
Master Sheppard was taking in sea-coal."
</p>

<p>
"Ay.  Yesterday forenoon.  I know."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, to-night.  Just now, as I came by."
</p>

<p>
"Just now!  What nonsense is the child's
tongue talking?  Sea-coal again, quotha?  when
Mistress Sheppard was ratin' of him fast as any
mill-clapper but this very morning only in my
hearing, for having more sea-coal in than the
'King's Arms' can use this side o' Yule-tide, if all
the king's horses, and all the king's men, and
the king himself into the bargain, should come
an' put up.  An' main and put about is Mistress
Sheppard with his craze, as she calls it.  'Just
like men,' says she.  'An' no wonder,' says I, 'for
sarteny there's no denyin' you may have too
much o' the best o' God's gifts.  And what with
Sheppard's sea-coal extravagance, and what with
his oysters&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oysters!" exclaimed Ruth.
</p>

<p>
"Ay.  Nasty slippy things.  Two big boatloads
o' them's landed within this se'nnight.
'Travellers,' says Master Sheppard, ''ll swallow as
many as you please to set afore 'em.' 'Maybe.
Worse taste theirs,' says Mistress Sheppard.  'But
they won't eat the shells, I reckon; and three
parts on 'em's just empty shells, she was tellin' of
me; and as she says, says she, 'a groat a year
paid for 'em quarterly 'd be a main sight more'n
they're worth.' No, no, ladybird, you must ha'
mistook.  Like as not 'twas only the barge comin'
to a standstill by the gate.  Got stuck in the mud.
The water thereabouts doesn't lie as thick as a six-pence."
</p>

<p>
"Will father be in soon, did he say, Maudlin?"
</p>

<p>
"He bid us not wait up for him; and to lock
all but the postern-gate hard an' fast.  He might
be late, he said, havin' business to settle across at
the 'King's Arms' with some dealers."
</p>

<p>
"In what?"
</p>

<p>
"Lord!  how inquisitive the child is to-night.
In grain, I reckon."
</p>

<p>
"From where?"
</p>

<p>
"Bless us!  Ay, from Ware, for aught I know.
Come, Ruth, an' you won't touch bit nor sup, let's
to bed," and Maudlin rose yawning from her
chair, and crossed with the aid of her stout
silver-headed staff to the foot of a broad oaken
staircase at the other end of the apartment.  "Ho, you!
Barnaby lad.  A light here!" she cried in shrill
tones, rapping the end of her stick vigorously on
the bare polished floor.  "A light here, I say!
Plague seize Sleepyhead!" she grumbled on, when
no response was forthcoming; "Snorin' away in his
owl's roost a'ready, I'll dare swear.  Barnaby!
Barnaby!"
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said Ruth, pointing up the staircase, to
where the moonbeams streaming in through the
criss-cross mullioned panes, flooded all the length
of a long gallery to almost the clearness of day,
"We want no light but that;" and followed at a
more sober pace by Maudlin, she tripped up the
stairs towards a door opening into a circular stone
chamber, whose vaulted roof was supported in its
centre by a huge pillar of roughly-hewn stone,
graced about its base with rusty iron rings, and
remnants of chain, whilst a concourse of
plethoric-looking sacks lay stacked about the floor, which
was of grayish flags seamed and worn as if by
the ceaseless tread of feet, especially round the
pillar.
</p>

<p>
Icy chill the air struck in this place; and with
no little shivering and shuddering old Maudlin
hurried on through it as fast as her rheumatic
twinges permitted.  "'Tis a cruel shame!" she
muttered, and the observation was by no means
a novel one in her mouth, "that you can't get
snug between the sheets without first catchin' your
death o' cold; and havin' your wits all terrified
out o' you with passin' through that gruesome
den."  Not, however, till she was well clear of the
vaulted chamber, and had gained the corridor
beyond, did Maudlin indulge in the latter part of
her running commentary.  "Marry!  I come goose-flesh
from top to toe when I think of all the poor
souls those walls have seen die an' rot."
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said Ruth, "but that was only the
Debtors' Prison, where the poor creatures were
kept when they couldn't pay their rents and their
tithes to the great lords and barons who used to
live here.  The state prison&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Lord forgive us!" shuddered Maudlin, "and
state that poor skeleton Master Lockit says they
found there was in, you may depend.  Every
bone rheumatics and lumbago, I doubt Ugh!
Yes, I know.  It lies down below water-mark, and
opens into the underway that runs to Nether Hall."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! nonsense, Maudlin," laughed Ruth.  "That's
an old wives' tale."
</p>

<p>
"And what if it be, quotha?" bridled Maudlin.
"What if it be?  Aren't old wives' tales as good as
young maids' tittle-tattle?  I tell thee, child, as
sure as we stand here there's a clear way beneath
us; though it may have as many twists and
crinkum crankums, I grant ye, as a half-scotched
adder&mdash;all the mile and a half to Nether Hall.
But him that's a mind for tryin' o't, 'll find
himself when he's done, in the cellar beneath the
ruined tower that's nearest the Hall, an' turnin',
as one may call it, head to tail about, he'll be back
again by the moat dungeon-door, down just under
our feet Unless he likes to stop short by the
deep black hole in the wall, which Master Lockit
has it&mdash;and, as times go, he's a fair truthbider,
though his tales are a'most as long as our
cat's&mdash;Master Lockit has it, opens up into your father's
sleeping chamber.  But hark ye, Ruth, now don't
you be telling young Lee about all that, mind; or
he'll be for tryin' of it There's not a venturesomer
harebrain than he in all the shire, let him once
set his mind to a thing."
</p>

<p>
"I doubt," carelessly smiled Ruth, "he knows
the fine tale well enough."
</p>

<p>
"Tale!  Tale again!  Well, well, and he's
pleased to think it so 'tisn't Maudlin 'd have him
taught better.  More by token that there's death
in it."
</p>

<p>
"Death!" echoed Ruth, her smiles fading.
</p>

<p>
"Choked," answered Maudlin, slowly nodding
her head up and down, "with smoke-damp that'd
stifle all the breath out of your body before you
were six yards in."
</p>

<p>
It was Ruth's turn to shudder.  "Well, what
does it matter?" she said, when having closed and
bolted the door of the little bedchamber they had
now entered she put her arms round Maudlin's
neck and kissed her, "while there's our darling
little river and Lawrence's boat.  By the way,
Maudlin, he's christened her the 'Queen Ruth!'"
</p>

<p>
"Has he now?" delightedly smiled Maudlin.
"That's main pretty of him.  Though I doubt
Master Rumbold'll be none so pleased.  Red rags
at a bull's much the same as talk about kings an'
queens to him.  He's all for lord protectors and
cattle o' that colour.  But never you fear,
sweetheart; there'll be none o' them ever set up while
Lawrence Lee's above ground, and he'd send all
the lord protectors ever hatched flyin' before they
set foot within a hundred miles o' Hoddesdon.
He's like his father before him, rest his soul; and
all for King Charles."
</p>

<p>
"You think so?" said Ruth brightly.
</p>

<p>
"Ay; that's my own blithe ladybird at last,"
cheerily cried the old woman.  "Sunshine makes
pretty maids' eyes sweeter than 'clouds, let me
tell thee.  And for the red roses instead o' white
ones&mdash;hark!" went on the housekeeper, as the gate
tower-clock chimed eight.  "There's a long spell o'
beauty sleep to be got yet.  So have with thee.
Say thy prayers, and then shut fast thine eyes,
and I'll answer for it we'll be having all the red
roses back the morn."
</p>

<p>
And then returning Ruth's embrace, Maudlin
dismissed the young girl to her chamber, which
lay immediately beyond.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
THE OLD RYE HOUSE.
</h3>

<p>
When the Rye House was built, or at least
its gate-tower wing of which we are
now speaking, and which was as old
as the time of King Henry the Sixth,
probably no dwelling of any importance, with the
exception of Nether Hall, a still more ancient
baronial structure, stood within miles of it.
</p>

<p>
Strong as rocks were its fortified outer walls;
and in many parts its interior walls were three
feet thick.  This was the case with the old
"Debtors' Prison," lying at the older wing's
extreme end, and forming the angle connecting it
with the new wing, which dated only from the time
of Queen Elizabeth.  In this debtors' prison Master
Rumbold, as we have seen, now stored his malt.
The wall separating Maudlin Sweetapple's little
sleeping chamber from the more spacious one
occupied by Ruth, was of at least equal strength
and solidity with the walls of this storing room;
but while in the one case the surface showed the
bare hewn stone, polished only by the hand of
time, panellings carved in many a quaint device,
and reaching half-way to the flat oak-timbered
ceiling, lined the "Lady's Bower," as time beyond
all count, Ruth's room had been called.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Ruth's bower.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Here she held sway undisputed; spending in it
hours of her lonely days when her father was
absent from home, as of late she noted he so
frequently had been.  So she sat strumming on the
broken and half-stringless virginal, or spelling out
the crabbed type of several worm-eaten books,
chiefly poems&mdash;long winded, wordy things enough.
Still she cared for them in a fashion; and one
volume, whose title-page set forth that its contents
were from the pen of one William Shakespeare, a
play-actor, took her mightily.  Line after line she
would tell you of many of the long speeches
and odd sayings it contained; though she kept
her studies to herself, for Maudlin had not very
much of a turn for book-learning, and Master
Rumbold always said, if it had not been for the
Bible, and that godly person Mr. Foxe's <i>Book
of Martyrs</i>, child of his should not have been
taught to read at all.  Then as to writing, he was
near never speaking one word more to Madam
Lee after one fine day when he made the frightful
discovery that she had been teaching the little
girl so successfully to make pot-hooks and hangers,
that long before Lawrence was out of the alphabet
Ruth had been writing on her own responsibility,
and in unmistakeable fair round hand: "Fear
God.  Honour the King."  Wroth indeed was
Master Rumbold over the "fine surprise" thus
prepared for him by instructress and pupil.  The
knowledge, however, could not be unlearned; and
such a penwoman as Ruth remained till the day
of her death you might go a hundred miles and
not find.
</p>

<p>
And so with her wheel and her tapestry-frame
for her father's company, and her graver
accomplishments for the solitude of the Lady's Bower,
Ruth contrived to live as happily as any princess.
Solitude is, however, no term to connect with
the spot where the birds sang their sweet music
the livelong day amid the beechen branches which
swept the panes of the old painted oriel window,
and the wind sighed gently in the long summer
evenings through the ivy trails and creepers which
Ruth trained about its carved stone-cornices, or in
his rougher moods snarled and blustered, like the
tyrant he can be, round the ancient house.  But
in Ruth's eyes the broad look-out from that window
always wore a beauty, and with all her fifteen
years' experience she had not been able to
determine whether that expanse of lowly undulating
meadow-land and winding waters looked loveliest
in its spring and summer garb of green, tented
over with cloudless blue, or in autumn's grays and
russets, or clad in its pure white winter snow
robe; nor even whether golden sunlight, or the
moon's silvery sheen, as to-night she stood gazing
on it, pleased her best.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Rumbold's chamber.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Master Rumbold himself slept on the ground-storey,
in a room immediately beneath his stored
malt-sacks.  This chamber, tradition said,
contained in its stone flooring a trap-door opening
upon a ladder which conducted into the fearsome
dungeons underground, where prisoners used to
be thrust, bidding hope and the blessed air and
daylight farewell for ever.  The subject was, however,
one rarely touched upon in the maltster's presence
by those who best knew his humours; for he
would either smile in bitter contempt, or&mdash;and
indeed that more generally happened&mdash;frown
angrily; and, let his mood be the one or the
other, always turned the conversation at last with
some half-uttered remark that so might it, or
might it not be, and that he had simply occupied
the room ever since he had been master of the
place, because it commanded a watch on both
wings of the house.  The quaintly timbered walls
of the new wing contained the malting-house;
while its gabled roof stretching up stiff as cat's
ears, afforded sleeping accommodation for the
domestic servants and the few workpeople living
on the premises.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The malting house.
</span>
</p>

<p>
The handsome guest-chamber, or keeping-room
as it was called, was not reserved merely for high
days and holidays, for Richard Rumbold had no
liking for such vain settings apart of time; but
was used as the general sitting-room, and extended
from end to end of the ground-storey.  Its three
windows fronted the great square smooth-shaven
grass-plot, which by tradition and courtesy was
called "the pleasaunce."  In the middle stood one
solemn big yew-tree, clipped, beehive-shape, and
surmounted by a leafy monstrosity which Maudlin
said was meant for a peacock.  Never a flower,
however, save the poor little buttercups and daisies,
whose heads were chopped off in a twinkling, if
they did venture to peer forth, ever starred that
dreary pleasaunce, for the maltster said he had
other uses for his money than to be wasting it on
gaudy nonsenses like flowers.
</p>

<p>
But returning now to the old wing, let us peep
in for a moment on old Adam Lockit, the gatehouse
keeper, in his sanctum deep hidden in the
recesses of the vaulted archway piercing the
tower, and giving on its outer side upon the
drawbridge, which was still let down at dawn, and
drawn up at sunset, by the massive old iron
chains working through the wall.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Barnaby Diggles.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Not a snugger corner in the whole establishment
than this of Master Lockit's.  Within the
last year or so, since he has not been so young as
he used to be, and the dragging at those heavy
chains has come to be a bit of a pull upon him,
though he is a hale enough man for his threescore
and ten, he has condescended to accept the assistance
of a lad, employed originally as a Jack-of-all
trades in the malting-yard, but promoted to the
dignity of domestic factotum by reason of sundry
excellent qualities.  Foremost among these stand
unimpeachable honesty and placid temper.  A
characteristic less distinguishing Barnaby Diggles,
for so the lad was named, was animal courage.
He was, in other words, an arrant coward; in the
matter at all events of hobgoblins and things of
the sort.  He was, however, but just turned of
sixteen; and time as yet had never tried his mettle
with any real and substantial danger.  Meanwhile,
nothing so much charmed him as having his imagination
tortured with ghost stories by the village
gossips; unless, indeed, it was to sit and incline his
ears to the hundred and one yarns of all countries
and ages that Adam Lockit loved at least as much
to spin.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The gatehouse room.
</span>
</p>

<p>
When Barnaby is not to be found after his
day's work for love nor money, you are safe to
run him to earth in the gatehouse room.  A Sindbad's
valley it is to him, a Hassan's cave, with all
its treasures of crossbows and battle-axes, and
catapult relics; its bits of chain-armour, its
battered helmets, stags' antlers, and hunting-horns,
for all and each of which Adam had his story to
tell, as vividly as if he had been honoured by the
personal acquaintance of Joan of Arc and William
Rufus, or gone a buck-hunting in Hainault Forest
with the merry monks of Waltham or bluff King Hal.
</p>

<p>
What gruesome tales too, Master Lockit, sitting
of bitter winter nights in his warm ingle neuk.
could tell you between the whiffs of his pipe,
about yonder spiral staircase, "There, just behind
you," which goes winding up past the nail-studded
iron clamped door, shutting in the old wing's upper
storey.  Ever so high, aloft to the tower roof, with
the spiked vane atop of its tall twisted chimney.
"But he was speakin' mainly," he was, Adam
would say, "of where it went round an' round,
an' down an' down to what was just wine and
wood cellars now, but 'twas no such honest end
as that they were scooped out for hunnerds and
hunnerds, if so be 'twarn't thousands o' years agone.
And Master Rumbold might say what he pleased,
an' deny it you as he liked, 'twere just for all the
world a honeycomb o' cells an' passages, openin'
right an' left into dungeons, till you come out by
the weir, over against the ruins o' Nether Hall."
</p>

<p>
"Go on! go on!" Barnaby would gasp, writhing
in ecstasy at the recital.  "Slidikins!  I'm all
goose-flesh from top to toe!  Master Lockit, go on!"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Master Lockit's word pictures.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"More idiot you," Adam would rejoin, puffing
away with immeasurable but secret content in the
effect produced by his word picture of their hidden
surroundings.  "What is it to the likes of us?
An't such things all done with now?  I'm speakin',
I am, of the good old times when royal kings
an' queens theirselves wasn't safe on their gold
thrones, for blows in the dark."
</p>

<p>
"Happen it might come again," Barnaby would
murmur, staring with hopeful rounded eyes into
the blazing logs; but when the old belfry clock
overhead boomed its warning to bed, Master
Diggles stumbling half blind with terror to his
sleeping-room in the gabled roof, was a sight not
easily to be forgotten.
</p>

<p>
That same iron-clamped door atop of the tower
staircase opened&mdash;if indeed one may so speak of a
door which so rarely was put to its use&mdash;into a
chamber called the Warder's Room.  Not having
been inhabited for a generation or two, it was of
course reputed to be haunted by a "White Woman,"
and that was no more than truth and fact;
for many an hour Ruth spent in it, weaving
romances out of her own brain, for the mail-clad
knights and wimpled ladies whose pictured forms
gleamed dimly from the rich oak wainscoted
walls, and the designs and quaint devices of their
panellings which accorded with those on the walls
of Ruth's room, lying immediately beyond.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Ruth romancing.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Ruth had a theory that this suite of rooms on
the upper storey of the gatehouse wing had in
olden times been occupied by the lord and lady
of the ancient mansion; and the notion was
probably a correct one, since in no part of the place
were traces of such magnificence to be seen as
here.  Fragments of painted glass glowed in the
mullioned windows, showing scraps of monstrous
griffin-like heads and scaly tails, and enscrolled
letters, of which only one word in one of the
upper lights of Ruth's window remained
entire&mdash;"Loyaulté."
</p>

<p>
Time and wear had so polished the wood of this
chamber's richly-parqueted floor that its smooth
surface reflected, like some quiet pool, the
tall-backed chairs of tawny and gilt Cordovan leather,
ranged stiffly against the walls, and about the long
narrow oaken table covered with its faded velvet
drapery; and the massive proportions of the huge
carved oaken chest, capacious enough to shut in
one of the mailed knights, or even portly
brown-frocked Abbot Benedict Ogard of Waltham Abbey
himself, who smiled, come fair weather come foul,
come day come night, so unctuously down on you
from his recess beside the loftily-coped fireplace.
</p>

<p>
Ruth could very well recall the time when the
lower portion of the walls of this room had been
hung with Flemish tapestry, embroidered with
subjects from the Old Testament and early
Grecian lore.  One winter, however, when King
Frost intruded so tyrannically in-doors that people
shivered in their beds, Maudlin Sweetapple had
stripped down the greater part of this tapestry to
make curtains for Ruth's room.  If in cutting
away the tattered and hopelessly unmendable
parts of it, she had patched the stuff together
again in such fashion as to leave Solomon in all
his glory turning a summersault on the extreme
tip of Jonah's whale's nose, and Goliath's gory
head frowned grimly from the neck of the Trojan
horse, did it not all serve every whit as well for
keeping the wind away?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The warder's room.
</span>
</p>

<p>
No doubt the situation of the Warder's Room,
cut off as it was so completely from the rest of
the house, had first obtained it its ghostly renown;
one not likely to dwindle, by the knowledge that
its outer door giving on the staircase was always
kept locked.  This, however, was no more than
an ordinary precaution; since the room stood literally
in the very portal of the whole house, though
time had brought its changes, and various small
doors in the new wing now admitted by the wicket
the maltster's few visitors and his workpeople to
the malt-yard.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A grim greeting.
</span>
</p>

<p>
The master of the house himself did not set foot
inside the Warder's Room twice in a year; and
when on that May morning, before starting for
Nether Hall, Ruth entered it, according to her
daily custom, to let a little fresh air and sunshine
into its grim silence, she had been startled at
perceiving her father standing with folded arms and
sombre brows near the hearth, gazing into its cold
blackness as if lost in moody thought.  On
becoming conscious of her presence, however, he
had roused up from his abstraction, and with
a hurried and absent "Good morrow, child," he
turned and went out, locking the door behind him.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br><br>
HOW MASTER RUMBOLD TOLD LAWRENCE LEE<br>
WHAT THE VERY AIR MIGHT NOT HEAR.
</h3>

<p>
This recollection of the morning, troubles
Ruth strangely now, as she sits in the
broad window-seat of her own room,
her eyes fixed indeed on the fair moon-lit
scene before her, but for once seeing nothing
of its beauty.  Vague fears and suspicions and
dread of coming evil weigh down her heart, as one
by one she threads together the incidents of this
May-day, which was to have been such a golden
one.  It is all in vain that she laughingly tells
herself her father has every right to perambulate
his own premises.  All in vain she argues that
Lawrence Lee may be as sulky as a bear with a
sore head, if it gives him any pleasure; and no
concern of hers.  Certainly not.  All the same too,
of course, it is to her if a legion of coal-barges
come their way, so long as it is not she who stands
in Master Sheppard's shoes.
</p>

<p>
For her part, however, Ruth could not consider
the landlady of the "King's Arms" at all a bad
sort.  On the contrary, she entertained a great
liking for her.  Folks were fond of saying that
Mistress Sheppard had a shrewish tongue; but
Ruth had never felt its edge.  The good woman
was as foolish as everybody else in the matter of
spoiling the little mistress of the Rye House; and
though she would as soon tell a prince of the
blood a piece of her mind, as she would the
stable-boy of her own establishment, if she saw fit, she
would have vowed the old dun-cow to be white
as milk, if it could have afforded Ruth any
satisfaction; or declared that Master Richard Rumbold
was the most urbane and delightful gentleman in
all the country, though no love, to put it mildly,
was lost between her and her opposite neighbour.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The hostess of the "King's Arms."
</span>
</p>

<p>
One reason for this among divers others, was
their difference of opinion concerning the sign of
her hostelry.  What easier, the maltster always
insisted, than to change it from the "King's
Arms" to the "Commonwealth Arms?" or some
such reasonable name?  There could be no offence,
he argued, to anybody in that.  But Mistress
Sheppard maintained there was, and much offence
too.  She would stand by and see no such senseless
choppings and changings.  There had never
been anything common about the place, since
place it was; and shouldn't be while she was above
ground.  And what did the man want of such
notions?  And Master Sheppard, if he could have
answered that question, as perhaps he might,
maintained a discreet silence, as indeed is the only
safe course when one finds one's self betwixt two
stools, as his lot in life placed him; for he was
never certain whether he stood more in awe of his
wife or of Master Rumbold.  Once, it is true, he
ventured so far as to hint to her, that for the good
of the house, and the sake of peace, it might be
well to think over Master Rumbold's suggestion,
and that he, Sheppard, was agreeable, if so be&mdash;but
having got thus far he was pulled up by Mistress
Sheppard, who said she "was not agreeable; that
those who didn't like the sign might spare their
custom, and the good o' the house'd be none the
worse for lack o' their company."  And so the sign
remained true to its colours, and an eyesore and a
thorn in the flesh to roundhead Master Rumbold.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Smouldering fires.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Differences between neighbours were, however,
unfortunately common enough in those troubled
times; for troubled they were.  It is true that the
old quarrel between the king and the parliament,
which had brought Charles the First to his sad
death at Whitehall, had been patched up very
neatly more than twenty years ago now, when
his son, King Charles the Second, had been restored
to the throne; but the feelings of the people
were like smouldering fires, and ready as ever to
break out in discontent.  The country, moreover,
was divided, not now, as then, into those who
did approve of its being governed by a king and
those who did not; but there were many loyal
enough sober-minded folks, and holding quite
varying forms of religious belief, who were sorely
disappointed with the manner in which the king,
whom they had helped to restore with so much
expense of precious lives and of money, governed;
or, more properly, neglected to govern.  Yes, a
careless "Merry Monarch"&mdash;all very well to call
him so&mdash;but your merry men and women are frequently
cruelly selfish ones, and contrive to bring
tears into other people's eyes every time they
are pleased to laugh.
</p>

<p>
Then, too, there were many who dreaded the
day when Charles's brother, the Duke of York,
should succeed him on the throne.  There seemed
hardly any doubt that he had adopted the Roman
Catholic form of belief; and a strong impression
prevailed that Charles was also greatly inclined
to do the same.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Merry Monarch.
</span>
</p>

<p>
How far this was true can, perhaps, never be
fairly determined.  The king's pleasures always
interested him vastly more than religious
questions of any kind, and the fears of those who
dreaded to see England fall back under popish rule
were probably exaggerated.  It is very certain
that these ideas were fed by dangerous men, who
for their own selfish ends spread alarms of popish
plots and conspiracies which existed nowhere but
in their own mischievous brains; and many
harmless peace-abiding Roman Catholics were hunted
to prison and death, solely for the crime of being
faithful to the creed they had been reared in.
These did not, however, remain entirely unavenged,
for the love of fair play and of justice
triumphed in the end; and the wretches who had
persecuted their fellow-men under the pretence of
religion were many of them severely punished,
and few pitied them.
</p>

<p>
The father of Lawrence Lee had died, fighting
for King Charles the First on Worcester field;
while Richard Rumbold had lost his eye in the
selfsame struggle, serving the Parliamentary forces.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A dark desire.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Rumbold hated the Stuart race; and when he
used to hear Madam Lee teaching her little Lawrence
to flourish his chubby hands and cry, "God
save the king!" an ugly sneer would begin to
gather about his lips, though he would hold them
fast shut, for the Nether Hall folks were
prosperous and well-to-do; and the maltster, if he
could avoid it, never quarrelled with money.  It
was, besides, no easy matter to pick a dispute
with this young Lee, who troubled his head so
vastly little about the affairs of the nation, and
whose whole mind was taken up in the management
of his farm.
</p>

<p>
As to his heart, it was divided between his
mother and his old playmate and constant friend
Ruth; and though Ruth's play-days were fast
ebbing away, and the old games were now frowned
upon by her as silly and rompish, Lawrence cared
for her every whit as much as ever; and Rumbold
perceiving this, thought he saw in it a turn for
the serving of his own purposes.  And when one
day, about the time of this story's opening, the
maltster being in one of his gloomier moods, which,
indeed, had grown so strangely frequent that he
was rarely out of them, chanced to launch forth
into one of his tirades against the king and his
government, and said that "sooner than see daughter
of his, wife of a man who loved a Stuart, be
that Stuart Charles or James, or Tom, Dick, or
Hal, he would see her in her coffin."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
An angry altercation.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Love!" replied Lee, turning a little pale as
the maltster spoke, "is a strong word, Master
Rumbold."
</p>

<p>
"Your father loved the first Charles Stuart,"
said Rumbold with knitted brows.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, to the death!" sighed the young man;
"but I'll warrant 'tis little enough his present
majesty remembers that."
</p>

<p>
Rumbold looked up quickly, and the dull glitter
of his eye brightened into a glance of searching
scrutiny as he fixed it on Lawrence.  "An
ungrateful race always, these Stuarts," he said with
a shrug.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, I say not that," rejoined Lee.  "Your
poor bedesman may know every scratch and mark
upon his little scraped-up hoard; but can your
rich trader tell you one from another of his coffered
guineas?  And king's friends are so.  Countless
as the grain I sow in my fields."
</p>

<p>
"To be as soon scattered to the winds, and
trod under foot," growled Rumbold.  "Put not
your trust in princes."
</p>

<p>
"I'd as lief trust one," smiled Lawrence, who
knew his Bible too, "as any other child of
man."
</p>

<p>
"You speak idly, as a parrot chatters," said
Rumbold in displeased tones; "and, in truth, I
have long taken you for a&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused with a jerk.  The word on his lips
was scarcely one calculated to win over the young
man to his ideas, and he substituted the milder
epithet of "featherbrain."
</p>

<p>
"I thank you for your compliment, Master
Rumbold," said Lawrence swelling a little, and
glancing silently, but proudly, round on his neat
barns and ricks, among which they chanced to be
standing.  "I flattered myself my brains were
none so empty."
</p>

<p>
"Psha!" returned Rumbold; "a man may be a
Mr. Worldly Wise, and still a fool and a beggar
touching the treasure that waxeth not old.  Think
you that the storing of barns and the breeding of
fat oxen will bring a man peace at the last?"
</p>

<p>
"It may help to it, I doubt," answered the
young proprietor, "if it so be that that man
uses bounteously the wealth his barns and his
cattle bring him.  Not hoarding it greedily, but
sharing it with those who need it.  Then heaven,
I take it, is like to bless our store."
</p>

<p>
The maltster wagged his head impatiently.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Lawrence speaks out.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Though in sooth," went on Lawrence, "I
require not you to remind me, Master Rumbold,
that though a man bestow all his goods to feed
the poor, and hath not real charity, he is sounding
brass indeed; and Heaven, that seeks pure gold
only, will have none of him.  I know, of course,
as well as you do, that a clear conscience&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And what," interrupted Rumbold, wincing
involuntarily as Lee uttered these last words, and
gazing gloomily into the muddy duck-pool at his
feet, "what may be your notion of that?"
</p>

<p>
"Of a clear conscience?" lightly laughed
Lawrence.  "Why, first and last, at all events, that
its owner never do his neighbour any wrong."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A wrangle.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"And who is my neighbour?" muttered Rumbold,
as if speaking to himself, and still keeping
his eye moodily fixed on the turgid water.  "Answer
me that, Lawrence Lee."
</p>

<p>
"Who is not?" replied Lee, repressing a yawn,
but with a cheery smile.  "I take it, we're
neighbours all.  Everything that breathes; from old
Shock here"&mdash;and he bestowed a friendly pull on
the grizzled ears of the sheep dog, who stood
poking his cold nose into his master's hand&mdash;"up
to the king himself.  What's the matter, Master
Rumbold?" for the maltster started and bit his
nether lip, as if in some sudden pain.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, boy," he said.  "What should be?"
</p>

<p>
"The king himself&mdash;God bless him!" continued
Lee, waxing unusually eloquent, for ordinarily
he was not a man of many words.  "And that if
we do&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do, do!" cried Rumbold, wincing again.
"The old story.  Always with your sort.  And
faith may go to the wall.  Well, if we do what
forsooth?" he added, not without curiosity.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, if it please you better," answered Lawrence
good-humouredly, "for it is all one;&mdash;if we
<i>don't</i> do harm, and work no evil against any
man:"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Upon him who doeth evil, evil must be done,"
said Rumbold in deep melancholy tones.
</p>

<p>
"That," returned Lawrence, recoiling a pace
and gazing in perplexity at his companion, "that
was not the teaching, Master Rumbold, of Him
who died for all men.  I doubt 'tis the same as if
one should say, Evil must be done that good may
come."
</p>

<p>
"Ay," muttered Rumbold, folding his arms
upon his breast and setting his lips firmly, "it
must."
</p>

<p>
"Why?  Fie, now, fie!" laughed Lawrence,
fixing his eyes with something of uneasy curiosity
in their clear, dark depths, on Rumbold's face.
"That, they say, is the Jesuits' watchword.  Who
would have thought to hear it from the lips of
godly Master Rumbold?"
</p>

<p>
"You mock me," returned Rumbold; "I am
the worst of sinners."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, nay, but I trust not," said Lee, getting
really uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
"You mock me, I say," reiterated Rumbold.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven forbid!" ejaculated Lee.  "It is rather
that you mock me; for by my faith I do not
understand you to-night, Master Rumbold."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The whisper of a conspirator.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Listen," hoarsely said Rumbold, turning
suddenly on Lee, and gripping him by the elbow;
"you shall understand.  I will explain, but not
here," he went on, dropping his voice to a
whisper, and casting a far-seeing, cautious glance
round.  "Not here: there may be eavesdroppers.
Hark! what's that?"
</p>

<p>
"Only the beasts munching their supper in the
stables," said Lee.  "They will tell no tales."
</p>

<p>
"The very air must not hear," said Rumbold.
</p>

<p>
"Why, if it is so particular as all that, then,"
rejoined Lawrence, still half jestingly, but growing
less and less light about his heart, "come this
way."  And pushing open a wicket, he conducted
his companion along a rather miry slip of by-road
towards the apple orchard, which stretched behind
and around the ruined gatehouse, whose jagged
outlines were beginning to stand out grim and
gaunt in the sickly rays of the moon.  Wading
through the long grass so thickly carpeting the
ground up to the tower, that its base was
completely hidden, Lee conducted Rumbold to the
top of a small flight of broken stone steps, so lost
in an overgrowth of ivy trails and brambles as to
be invisible to stranger eyes; but Lee, with a
thrust of his hand, parted the leafy screen, and
signed to Rumbold to follow him down the steps,
which led to a low, iron-clamped and heavily
padlocked door deeply sunken in the wall of the
tower's foundations.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A secret vault.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a well-screened spot, is it not?" said Lee,
answering Rumbold's inquiring glances.
</p>

<p>
"Well secured," said the cautious Rumbold,
who had not much opinion of mere unaided twigs
as safeguards, and seemed more disposed to admire
the huge iron padlock adorning its latch.  "What
do you store here?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing?"
</p>

<p>
"The place&mdash;except for a few bones, which may
have been man's or sheep's for aught I know,
or ever gave a thought to&mdash;is full of emptiness."
</p>

<p>
"Yet you keep it as sealed as if it shut in
untold riches."
</p>

<p>
"As for the matter of that, it does, too, in a
roundabout sort of way," said Lawrence smiling
and colouring a little.  "Or it may do so; for 'tis
said&mdash;though I will not answer for the truth of it,
that if you follow your nose far enough, the way
it leads, you will find yourself in the vaults under
your own gatehouse.  Our houses&mdash;yours and
mine&mdash;Master Rumbold, were built in queer
times; when a man could not call his life his own.
And when he dared not show his face above
ground, slipped away as he could under it."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
In darkness.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"And a fig then for his pursuers," said Rumbold,
as he stepped into the vault, whose darkness was
only lightened by the moon-rays feebly struggling
in through the grating of a loophole high up in
its walls.  "A fig for them, hey?"
</p>

<p>
"As you say," said Lawrence, faintly echoing
the low laugh of his companion, which reverberated
far away, in mocking unearthly discords, as though
challenging the pair to explore the place's
long-forgotten intricacies.  "I doubt they must have
been as successful as if they sought needles in a
bottle of hay."
</p>

<p>
"Shut the door!" said Rumbold.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence obeyed, and what further Richard
Rumbold had to say was heard by no eavesdroppers
save the slug and reptile creatures who had long
made the place their own.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A change for the worse.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Some hours later the door opened again, and
one of the two men reappeared.  Peering first
cautiously right and left, he locked the door
behind him and stole hurriedly up the steps.  The
figure of this man is assuredly that of Lawrence
Lee, but strangely unlike his light bright step is
that stumbling, swaying gait; and can that ashen
white face, those eyes startled and staring, as if
they had met some fearful thing, indeed be his?
And where is Rumbold?
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap06"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
SOMETHING IN THE WATER.
</h3>

<p>
One thing only was quite certain, that
the maltster was to be seen next
morning at the usual hour among his men.
As for Lawrence Lee, whatever Rumbold
had confided to him remained a secret as
far as the nature of it was concerned.  To hide,
however, from Ruth that something was amiss
with him was a more difficult task, and he had
failed in it.
</p>

<p>
During these last weeks, moreover, the Rye
House had grown into a very prison of dulness.
Rumbold, always a sombre and taciturn man,
had come to be like a stone statue moving about
the place, never speaking but when absolutely
compelled.
</p>

<p>
The recollection of all this, and of the events
of the past day, crowd bewilderingly now upon
Ruth's mind, as she sits, with her chin resting
upon her hand, gazing out into the night, from
which the young May moon is slowly fading.
Only a few stars cheer the surrounding darkness,
excepting yonder where the yellow lamp-light
streams through the close-drawn curtains of the
guest-parlour window of the King's Arms.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A cure for care.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Many a summer evening, when Mistress Sheppard's
guests tarried as late as this, Ruth could
remember catching the echoes of merry laughter and
snatches of songs from that window; but though
the night was warm as a July one, not a sound
was to be heard save the low hooting of the owls
and the gurgling of the water in the moat.
</p>

<p>
She stretched her head from the window, to
listen for the familiar sound of her father's heavy
footfall up the wicket-path.
</p>

<p>
How late he stayed!
</p>

<p>
And Lawrence?  had he gone home yet in his
boat?  Surely.  And yet&mdash;ah! well.  What was
it all to her?  Why vex her head about it?  Why
not go to sleep and forget her fancies?  Fancy! were
those dark cloaked figures fancy forsooth?
Like some evil dreams, indeed, they haunted her
mind.  And that flash of cruel steel blue light?
No fancy that.  But what concern could it be
of Ruth's?  Why, a turn of her wheel would dispel
it all.  There is no remedy like a little bit of
diligent work for troublesome thoughts, or even
sad ones.  How provoking that the stupid thing
had not a shred of flax in it!  There it stood in
its corner, a beautiful wheel of ebony inlaid with
ivory, her father's gift last birthday, but like a
fair body without a soul, destitute of the flax.
How she could have worked away by the light
of the stars which were so brilliant that lamp-light
would be an utter superfluity&mdash;if only the flax had
been to hand!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Out in the moonlight.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Unluckily it all lay locked away, a splendid
store, in the big oak linen press, atop of the
keeping-room staircase; and just the least bit in the
world of extra courage was indispensable for
traversing those silent passages at this hour.  And
yet after all, a very little bit, for Ruth was no
coward.  The chief difficulty was to avoid
disturbing Maudlin.  It would be such a shame to do
that.  The old woman lay so comfortable&mdash;leagues
away in the land of dreams.  Ruth could see
that, as she peeped at her through the half-open
door.  So soundly sleeping that she gathered
courage, and stepped tiptoe across the floor, out
into the corridors beyond, till she could see the
sacks away at its furthermost end in the storeroom,
all huddled together like hunchbacks under
the dim starlight, or&mdash;like those cloaked men who
had got out of the barge! and then Ruth shivered.
But that was little to be wondered at, for the
air of the store-room struck icy cold as she
stole on&mdash;on into the corridor where the linen
press stood.
</p>

<p>
Close beside it a small lattice afforded a glimpse
of the river just beyond the bridge.  There lay
the barge!  Still moored up alongside the bank;
a huge black blot upon the silvery water.
</p>

<p>
And the "Queen Ruth?"  Nay&mdash;as if it was
likely to be there now.  Why, her pretty little
cat Tab had as much to do with the big elephant
who lumbered by in the show yesterday, as the
merry, graceful, little "Queen Ruth" could have
with yonder ugly boat?  And yet, and yet&mdash;ah! what
a consolation it is to make sure of anything!
to crush out one's absurd fancies&mdash;dead, past all
coming to life again!  And how temptingly easy
in this case!  Quite as easy anyhow, as to be
standing there, dreaming and talking about it.
Only just to steal down by the stairs and through
the keeping-room, where the still smouldering
fire cast a few dull gleams, and so out by the
narrow path to the wicket.  Then but a step&mdash;but
softly, creep low for thy life, Ruth&mdash;in the
high wall's shadow, and drag the cloak, snatched
in haste from a peg, close and well about thy
face and shoulders.  And what if Rumbold should
be returning now?  But there is never a sound
save the flapping of the bats' wings, that beat in
her face, and bring her heart into her mouth.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Ruth goes exploring.
</span>
</p>

<p>
She was so near now to the gilded patch of
light upon the black road before the inn parlour
window, that had the pane been open, she must
beyond all question have caught the voices of
those within.  But though just for one instant she
paused, pressing her hand upon her beating heart
to listen, not so much as an echo reached her; and
she hurried on, towards the parapet of the bridge,
where it wound down lower and lower to the
little landing-stage&mdash;and leaned over.
</p>

<p>
Still tied to the stake lay the "Queen Ruth."  The
swift stream from the bridge gently swaying
her bows, and her gay cowslip posies and ribbon
knots fluttering in the breeze now fast springing up.
</p>

<p>
Ruth's heart sank.  Past all doubt then, here
was Lawrence hanging about, when he should
have been back at Nether Hall an age ago.  This,
surely, was no night to be loitering with&mdash;with
a parcel of coal-heavers; and Ruth shuddered.
Pray Heaven their calling was such an honest
one.
</p>

<p>
There she stood gazing with puzzled bent brows
upon the barge, lying motionless and black as
a funeral bier on the sluggish water, gleaming
leaden gray in the sickly starlight.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
footsteps on the bridge.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Slowly and sadly Ruth prepared to retrace her
steps.  Doubts and uncertainty would, after all,
she thought, have been preferable to this sight,
which did but strengthen her suspicions of she
knew not what.  Supposing&mdash;Hark!  A shuffling
of footsteps, and the sound of voices.  It must
be the inn party dispersing, and exchanging their
good-nights.  And Ruth turns to fly back to the
wicket.
</p>

<p>
Too late.  The tramp of feet was close upon her,
heavy and measured, but it was approaching from
the other side of the bridge; and Ruth dropped
upon her knees, cowering down under cover of
her cloak beneath the sheltering wall of the
parapet, till she looked all one with a heap of dry
rubbish of leaves and old straw swept up close
beside her.  In another instant these tramps will
have passed on.  For tramps doubtless they are,
bound for Newmarket.  Respectable travellers
would of course, at this late hour, have put up for
the night at Hoddesdon.  What even if they should
be footpads! and poor Ruth thinks longingly now
of her comfortable little bedchamber.  What
guineas, if she owned them, would she give to
find herself safe back in it!  Hush!  Hush!
Already the span of the near bridge is resounding
hollowly with their tread!  Suddenly the sound
ceases.  The party has clearly come to a halt, and
close upon her hiding-place; for though they
speak in subdued and almost stealthy tones, every
syllable is audible to her.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The conspirators.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"There it is," said one voice.
</p>

<p>
"Ay," muttered another.  "Roight enough.
Let's be gettin' for'ard."
</p>

<p>
"Wait!" peremptorily commanded a third voice
in soldier-like tones.  "Don't let us make any mistake."
</p>

<p>
"Oons!" impatiently grunted the second speaker;
"I tell you, colonel, 'tis the spot, if I knows it,
and I were born here.  Yonder stands the Rye
House 'telle'e, and yonder to to'ther side o' the
road&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Road!" interrupted the military voice rather
contemptuously, "you call it a road?  Why 'tis
scarce broad enough for a couple of broad-shouldered
loons like you to walk abreast.  Road
forsooth!"
</p>

<p>
"King's highway, then," laughed the first
speaker, whose accent was refined but disagreeably
sarcastic.
</p>

<p>
A low chorus of laughter greeted this remark.
</p>

<p>
"That he'll be lying low enough upon," went
on the first speaker, "before Oak Apple Day.
And is yonder gabled house the King's Arms,
friend?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay it be, my Lord Howard."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Something in the water.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Forward then.  Come, Walcot, if you've
done mooning.  What ails you, man?  Staring
at the water as if you saw your own double in it!"
</p>

<p>
"Do you see that?" hurriedly returned the
soldier.
</p>

<p>
"See what?" and then ensued a sound of shuffling
and scraping, as if the whole party was
crowding to the side of the bridge.
</p>

<p>
"Why yes, for sure we does," said the native
of the place, and whom Ruth recognized by his
voice to be a workman in the malt-yard named
Barber.  "I doubt if each on us had but one eye
apiece, like the measter's, we could see the moon
a shoinin' on the stream."
</p>

<p>
Ruth breathed again.
</p>

<p>
"But there is no moon.  'Tis gone."
</p>

<p>
"Starlight, then."
</p>

<p>
"That is too faint to cast any such reflections,"
objected Colonel Walcot.  "And see how it
flashes: there! close up against the steps, as
bright and sharp as forked lightning."
</p>

<p>
"Or a silver serpent," put in another voice.
</p>

<p>
"Or an eel," laughed Lord Howard; "come,
colonel, let's push on."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, nay, bide a minute," cried another voice,
which Ruth knew to belong to the foreman of
the malting-yard.  "The colonel's grace is right.
There is summat lyin' in the stream.  And 'tis
nayther fire nor fish, and if I might be speakin'
out my moind afore your lordship's worship, I
should say as 'tis for all the world like a swoord,
or one o' they skewer sort o' murdrous wepn's&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A rapier do you mean?" said Howard.
</p>

<p>
"Noa, noa, my lord, not just that, but a new
sort o' blood-spillin' invenshun that&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Save us!" shiveringly ejaculated the other
maltster.  "What if so be that 'tis a shadder, or
some evil sperrit warnin' us of the wickedness of
our ways, afore it be too late."
</p>

<p>
"Coward! white-livered loon!" savagely hissed
Lord Howard.  "What have we to do with
shadows, who fear neither man nor&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, oh!  Hush, hush, my lord," interrupted
a cringing unmelodious voice, "ye speak
unadvisedly."
</p>

<p>
"So do you, Master Ferguson," wrathfully cried
my lord, "as you'll find when we string up your
lean crow's neck for you to Master Sheppard's
sign yonder, if you don't keep your cant till we
ask for it.  Come, quick march."
</p>

<p>
Then with stealthy, but quick and measured
tramp, the whole party passed on.
</p>

<p>
Cramped in every joint, for she had scarcely
dared to draw breath, much less to stir, Ruth
ventured now to raise one corner of her cloak,
and peer after this strange company.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Strange guests for the "King's Arms."
</span>
</p>

<p>
One by one she saw their black figures disappear
from the flood of yellow light upon the road,
within the deep porch of the inn.
</p>

<p>
Dizzy and bewildered with what she had just
witnessed, she staggered to her feet, clinging for
support as she did so to the parapet.  Her eyes,
as she passed her hand across them to clear the
mists that blinded them, caught a dim confused
gleam of the object which had attracted the
attention of the party.  Within barely a dozen
paces of where she stood, it lay; half way between
the barge and the landing stage, forking and
zig-zagging just under the sluggish movement of the
water.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The flash of the missing weapon.
</span>
</p>

<p>
A sharp-pointed cruel-looking blade of some
description; but though Ruth, thanks to Master
Lockit's instructions, could tell you a dagger from
a sword, and a rapier from either, a vast deal
better than some folks could, she was not able
to give a name to this three-edged knife, with its
short dagger-shaped hilt of wood that stuck up
slantwise high and dry out of the water, among
the white rush stamens.  One like that she had
never seen.  No great marvel, however, if she
had not, for the pattern was of quite recent
French devising, and hardly likely so soon to have
found its way into a peaceful little Hertfordshire
hamlet, in the ordinary course of events; but
Ruth, as she bent over the water's edge with eyes
fixed on the thing, felt sure that something
extraordinary was going on about and around her.
Something too fearful to guess at.  Never a
doubt that this sword or spear, or whatever might
be its hateful name, was the thing which the man
Rumsey had let slip from his bundle on leaving
the barge.  That like one viper of its poisonous
brood, the thing was but one of more of its kind,
was equally clear.  But come what might, thought
Ruth, its own special and individual chances of
fulfilling the fearful end it was fashioned for,
should not be left it; and stealing down by the
parapet, and along by the water's edge till she
reached the spot, she knelt and stretched forward
her hand, grown cold as death, but steady and
straight to its purpose; and seizing the hilt of
the weapon, dragged it, dripping with the diamond
bright drops from the water, under her cloak.
<span class="sidenote">
Ruth strangely armed.
</span>
Then casting one keen glance round, and upwards
towards the inn, she sped along the bank, never
stopping till she reached the postern.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
MISTRESS SHEPPARD DOES NOT CARE FOR HER GUESTS.
</h3>

<p>
Mistress Sheppard was almost as
perfect a specimen of a landlady, as
her establishment was a model of an
inn; for who has not heard of that
famous King's Arms, within whose snug shelter
Master Isaak Walton loved to rest and sup, with a
friendly gossip after his day's angling in the waters
of the "Silver Lea," which almost washed the
ancient hostelry's walls?
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
The landlady of the inn.
</p>

<p>
Decidedly, even to her very little tempers,
Mistress Sheppard was a model of her class.
When the world wagged to her liking, her plump
peony cheeks so dimpled over with smiling
good-humour, and her voice, albeit always a trifle
shrill, was so kindly, that you experienced some
difficulty in bringing yourself to believe, what
nevertheless was true, that the face could look
thunderously black, and the voice set your teeth
on edge with its vinegar sharpness.
</p>

<p>
In justice, however, it ought to be added that
sunshine prevailed in Mistress Sheppard's nature,
and the storms threatened only when she had
what she called her "reasons" for them.  If
Sheppard called them "prejudices, unaccountable
prejudices," he only did so when she was safe out of
earshot.
</p>

<p>
To his great vexation and discomfiture, the
clouds hang very heavy on his wife's brow to-night.
It is clear she does not like these guests
who have sought the inn's hospitality; and when
the party arriving by road, passes through into
the parlour, she sits contemplating its door, which
is close shut by the one who last enters, in grim
meditative silence.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know whose looks I care for least
among 'em," she muttered, as at last she slowly
turned to fill the tankards of ale they had ordered.
"Eyes on a more hang-dog crew I never set.
With the brims o' their hats as hollow as cabbage
leaves, as if they was ashamed o' their own ugly
faces; as well they may be, and downright afeard
to be seein' what mine was like.  Why, I give
you my word, there wasn't one o' the lot looked
my way, to give me so much as a civil good e'en,
as they passed.  That's manners for you!"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" whispered Sheppard, imploringly, and
casting nervous glances towards the guest-parlour,
as Mistress Sheppard's tones ran up the gamut, till
they ended in a shrill treble.  "Hush!  There's a
dear woman.  Walls have ears."
</p>

<p>
"And so much the better if they have; for
then they'll be knowin' a piece o' my mind."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, hush! hush!  If the gentlemen should
overhear&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen, quotha! gentlemen!&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ay; there's a live lord among 'em."
</p>

<p>
"Live lord is there!  Then, beshrew me, if it's
at court he learnt his manners.  Our dame-school
brats know 'em better.  Why his sacred majesty&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, hush! hush!" agonizedly entreated Sheppard.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Lord Howard has his character.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"What should I hush for?  His own sacred
majesty, I say, always bids me a 'God save you,
Mistress Sheppard!' from his coach-door when his
coach pulls up here to change horses; and once&mdash;well
I remember it&mdash;his own royal fingers chucked
me under the chin.  No, I don't say you was by
and saw him do't; but he did.  Well, well, what's
your fine lord's name?  Bless the man; can't you
speak out? mumblin' as if you hadn't got a tooth
in your head!  Howard o' what?"
</p>

<p>
"Escrick.  Lord Howard of Escrick."
</p>

<p>
"M'ph!" murmured Mistress Sheppard, cogitatively
tapping her plump finger tips on the table.
"'Tis a good name, and a proud, is Howard.  But
your whitest flock's got its black sheep, they say.
And now I think on't, 'twas but t'other day&mdash;though
I don't at this minute recollect the hows
and the wheres&mdash;somebody that was in here, was
tellin' of me that there wasn't a daring
profligate among all the quality like this same
Howard of Escrick, an' not a shred o' principle or
honesty in him."
</p>

<p>
"An' what's all that to us?" said Sheppard,
with a feeble attempt at bravado, as he marshalled
the tankards on his tray.  "The best thing you
can do, is to give me the bottle o' Canary he's
ordered; an' be quick about it.  There's a good
woman.  Anyhow you've no call to complain of
his honesty; for hasn't he paid his reckonin' a'ready?
See if he hasn't."  And Sheppard triumphantly
threw down a gold piece.  "Now what do you
take him for?"
</p>

<p>
"A knave!" said Mistress Sheppard, pocketing
the gold, however, "or else a fool; for he lacks
credit, or wit, or both one and t'other who settles
for his goods afore he's got 'em.  There&mdash;there;
be off with thee.  Take em' what they want, and
tell 'em the sooner they're all off these premises
the better I shall like 'em.  Bless the man!  What's
come to thee, now?  Thy hands are shakin' like
froze syllabub.  Spillin' the ale all over the tray.
Here&mdash;give it me; I'll carry it in."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Master Sheppard in a hurry.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Sheppard, however, was too quick for her.
Ordinarily the less he bestirred himself, and the
more his bustling active-minded wife did for him,
even to the length of waiting personally on their
guests, the better pleased he was; but now he
absolutely pounced upon the tray, and carried it
off at double quick trot, leaving Mistress Sheppard
to stand looking after him in open-mouthed
amazement, as he disappeared, closing the door
of the guest-parlour carefully behind him.
</p>

<p>
"Hark! what was that?"  Her ears, she thought,
must have deceived her, rarely as they were given
to it.  Or did the lock of the door click and the
bolts scrape in their grooves as if stealthily
moved?
</p>

<p>
Mistress Sheppard stepped tiptoe across to the
door, and noiselessly grasping its handle, she
turned it and pushed at it, but to no purpose.
"I like not that," she said to herself, when after a
second attempt she turned away, and resuming
her post among her bottles and cups, sat with
knitted brows and eyes keenly riveted on the
sturdy old wainscoted walls opposite as if she
would fain have penetrated to the scene they hid.
"I like it not," and then she set her arms akimbo,
and gave a prolonged inquiring sniff.  "And never
a suspicion of tobacco neither," and deeper and
deeper gathered the frowns.  "That bodes no
good neither; for men must be ill at ease with
themselves indeed, before they forget to make
chimneys o' their mouths.  And not a sound,"
and she held her breath and listened intently.
"Not a sound!"
</p>

<p>
Not one, truly, that could reach her; for that
score or so of men, seated about the large table
placed across the room's upper end, all spoke in
half-whispering undertones, and ceased abruptly
as Sheppard entered with his tray.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Locked and bolted.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Bolt the door!" commanded the man seated at
the head of the table.
</p>

<p>
"I crave pardon, Master Rumbold," began Sheppard,
looking with a sickly smile from the speaker
to the door, and back again to the speaker; "but
my&mdash;my wife&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly," interrupted Rumbold.  "We don't
need Mistress Sheppard's assistance in this
business.  It's bad enough already."
</p>

<p>
"Bolt the door!  Dost hear, fellow?" said a
handsome and richly-attired, but dissipated-looking
man, with dark eyes and black-brown locks,
who was seated next the maltster.  "Bolt the
door, and don't be all night about it."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
One out of a baker's dozen.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Ah, good lack! good lack!" feebly ejaculated
Sheppard, no longer hesitating, and putting up
the bolts as fast as his shaking fingers would let
him.  "Something gone wrong?  Did you say
something was gone wrong?" and he gazed in
abject terror round the circle of gloomy faces,
looming amid the shadows cast by the one oil-lamp
hanging from the huge beam overhead, and which
was all the light the room boasted.  "What will
become of us all now?  I knew how 'twould be&mdash;I
always said it would&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Thanks to you," said the dark-eyed man, with
a malicious smile.
</p>

<p>
"Me!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay.  My Lord Howard's right there," growled
a stout thick-set man, somewhat far advanced in
middle age, who sat near the fireplace, occupied
in rubbing his shins with a tender hand.  "It's all
your infernal slippery banks we've to thank for
it.  Why the mischief can't you keep your garden
banks in decent order?"
</p>

<p>
"Are you quite sure you don't mistake after
all?" inquired Rumbold's neighbour of the last
speaker, glancing down as he spoke at the sheaf
of three-sided short blades spread out fan-wise
upon the table.  "There are twelve here."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, but 'twas a baker's dozen, my lord," said
another voice.  "Thirteen, so he says&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And I suppose I'm not a liar, Master Goodenough,"
cried the stout soldier, glowering sullenly
at the individual who had hazarded the last
observation.  "Nor a cowardly idiot neither, like some
folks here."  Then he set to rubbing again at his
damaged limb.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! the gracious powers forbid!" laughed Lord
Howard, lifting his white jewelled hand, "we're
all brave and honourable men here, surely.  And
vastly too clever to split like a bundle of twigs
about nothing at all."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, less than nothing; for by my faith,
Master Rumsey, I should be inclined to count this
loss a fine omen.  Thirteen's an unlucky number,
so old wives say.  And twelve of the things is
enough in all conscience."
</p>

<p>
"And too many to my thinking," approvingly
nodded Goodenough.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Playing with edge tools.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Even if forced to extremes," continued Howard,
"why, one of these sharp little Frenchmen here,"
and he began handling one of the blades as he
spoke, and laid it lightly across his finger, "would
do all the business in a twinkling.  What say you,
Master Rumbold?"
</p>

<p>
"That," answered Rumbold, breaking silence at
last, "is not the point."
</p>

<p>
"No, by my faith!  'Tis but the edge," cried
Lord Howard, with a grimace of sudden pain, and
hastily throwing down the weapon, "the foul
fiend's own grindstone must have sharpened the
confounded blade!"  And dragging his gossamer-laced
handkerchief from his pocket, he wound it
round his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Has it drawn blood, my lord?" timorously
asked Goodenough, turning pale, and craning his
neck forward.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A warning.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Ay, has it, Master Sheriff," replied Howard,
holding up his hand, and displaying its crimson-dyed
cambric swathing, "and this helps but little
to staunch it.  Thanks, Master Lee," he went on,
as Lawrence Lee, approaching from an obscure
corner, took the wounded hand in his, and bound
his own stout white linen handkerchief deftly
about it; "I had better not have been quite so
quick to meddle with it.  Have a care what you
are doing," he added, as Lee turned to replace the
blade beside the rest.  "Take warning by my fate."

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br><br>
MOONRAKERS.
</h3>

<p>
"I say," doggedly began Rumbold, and
taking no more notice of Lord Howard's
mishap than if it had not occurred,
"that this must be found, and
before morning, else it will betray us."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! we're betrayed!  We're betrayed!" shrieked
Sheppard, at the top of his small voice.
</p>

<p>
"Silence, idiot!" said Rumbold, turning on him
sternly; "and it is quite clear," he continued,
"that it must be lying somewhere between this
house and the river, since Colonel Rumsey is
certain that when he stepped out of the boat he had
it safe in the canvas bundle."
</p>

<p>
"I'll swear to that," said Rumsey.
</p>

<p>
"Now the garden has been thoroughly searched"&mdash;"Every
inch of it," chorused half-a-dozen voices.
</p>

<p>
"And that being the case," said the tall soldier,
advancing from the hearth, where he had been
standing gazing meditatively into the dying
embers, "perhaps you will find it worth your while
to heed now what I told you on the bridge.  You
may search in the garden till you're all blind.  I
tell you the thing fell into the water.  Come,
gentlemen," he went on, turning to those of the
party who had accompanied him, "I am not after
all, you see, such a moonraker as you would have
made me out, when I told you I saw something
shining in the water as we came by."
</p>

<p>
"Truly you did say so, Colonel," humbly admitted
those he addressed.
</p>

<p>
"Verily we should not have contemned his
assurance," ejaculated the snuffling tones of Master
Ferguson, as he clasped his clawlike fingers, and
turned upwards the ferret eyes gleaming beneath
a wig almost concealing his mean little forehead;
"for of a surety the hand of Providence is with
those who put their faith&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"In the water.  Just beyond a little two-oared
boat moored to a landing-stage at the bridge
foot."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A searching party.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Verily, I think we may place our confidence and
credence&mdash;" once more began the snuffling tones;
but they were interrupted by Lawrence Lee.
"Never mind that now, Master Ferguson," he
said.  "The best thing to be done is to go to work
and rescue this tell-tale knife before any prying
eyes have been beforehand with us."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, well said!" cried Lord Howard.  "Have
with you, then, Master Lee.  Come, friend," he
went on, addressing Sheppard, "down with your
bolts again."
</p>

<p>
But Sheppard hesitated, casting appealing
glances round.  "Why, what ails the fellow
now?" demanded Howard; "first he hesitates
at putting them up, and now he won't take them
down!"
</p>

<p>
"Mistress Sheppard&mdash;my&mdash;my wife!" stammered
the unfortunate man.  "She&mdash;that is, so
please your lordship's worship's grace, she's such
a wide-awake&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What the mischief!  Isn't she a-bed yet?"
laughed Howard.  "Come, come, landlord, I'm
afraid you rule your house sadly amiss."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I don't rule it, my lord.  'Tis Miss&mdash;Mistress
Sheppard who&mdash;who&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He speaks true enough there, my lord," said
Rumbold grimly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," gasped the poor man in tones of
relief; "Master Rumbold&mdash;he'll answer for me
I speak nothing but the truth.  Mistress
Sheppard&mdash;she's always the last in the place to go to
bed.  She likes&mdash;that's what she says, my lord&mdash;likes
to see all safe first.  And sure as a gun,
she's posted outside there in the passage.
And&mdash;and if the whole&mdash;whole gang of us goes
swarming out by the door here, like bees out of a
hive, she'll be following us to see what we're
after&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Quite true," nodded Rumbold; "and by midday
the whole parish will be twittering the
tale."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The wrong way out.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, these women!" groaned Howard; "they
must always be meddling.  Well, what's to be
done, then?  Shall we go hunting in couples, or
one at a time?"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis not to be risked," said Sheppard, shaking
his head.  "You see, my lord&mdash;saving your lordship's
presence and yours, gentlemen"&mdash;he added,
blinking his small eyes uneasily round on the
circle of his guests, who had risen to their feet,
impatient to begin the search, "Mistress Sheppard
doesn't seem to have taken much of a fancy,
so to speak, to a man-jack of the lot of you.
Don't like the looks o' you, she says.  And I'd
sooner be a mouse within sight of our cat Tiger
than havin' Mistress Shep&mdash;Sheppard&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Smell a rat," rather ruefully laughed Howard.
"Well, what's the remedy?"
</p>

<p>
"This," said Lee, who, having left the group
collected near the door, now stood beside a broad
lattice, looking from a recess near the hearth into
the garden, and commanding a view of the bridge.
"It gives upon the bowling-green, and then down
by the slope to the water.  Out with you!" and
unhasping the lattice pane as he spoke, he pushed
it open.  "Only, for your lives, step softly, softly!"
and he placed his finger warningly on his lips.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
What has become of it?
</span>
</p>

<p>
"This way," whispered Walcot, when, in less
than three minutes' time, the whole party, including
the limping Rumsey, stood out upon the velvet
smooth turf On they crept, in single file, till
they stood upon the edge of the shelf of tall
bracken, where, stooping down, they dispersed
along the bank close down by the water's brink.
"'Twas just hereabouts," said Walcot in a loud
whisper.  "There! there!  Stop a bit.  No.  Now
I think on't, 'twas of course farther along&mdash;close
by the barge."
</p>

<p>
"Here!  I have it!" cried one in a voice of
smothered but gleeful triumph.  "Alack! it was
but the battered handle of an old tin pot;" and
in dire vexation he dashed it down again.
</p>

<p>
For a good half-hour the search was continued,
until, wet through with their wadings and
dabblings, some showed signs of giving in.  Others
swore they would not budge till they had found
the missing thing.
</p>

<p>
"Then I take it we may as well part company
at once," yawned Lord Howard, "for it's washed
away into mid-stream long before now, depend on
it.  Come, Master Lee, what say you?  I'll dare
swear you know something of the water's
soundings hereabouts."
</p>

<p>
"I think 'tis likely enough, my lord," answered
Lawrence, catching Lord Howard's attack of
yawning.
</p>

<p>
"Then let it lie, and be hanged to it!" and the
nobleman sauntered back up the slope.
</p>

<p>
One or two of the party now proposed to return
to the inn and proceed with the business which had
brought them together; but Rumbold shook his
head.  "It is too late," he said: "three nights
hence we will meet again."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
An inhospitable landlord.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh! but not here," piteously entreated
Sheppard.  "Not here, Master Rumbold; don't say
it's to be here.  I never should hear the last of
it; I shouldn't indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"Peace with thy craven tongue!" said the
maltster with one of his grim smiles.  "No,
boys," he added, turning to the rest; "not here:
yonder at my own house, where last we met, in
the Warder's Room."
</p>

<p>
And with a gesture of farewell he left them,
while Lee betook himself home in his boat.
</p>

<p>
The rest, not without bestowing a good many
muttered left-hand compliments on the fumble-footed
Rumsey, separated in much the same order
as they had come,&mdash;some by the barge, which
soon lost itself among the mists of the river, others
making their way on foot by the Rye to Hoddesdon
and the neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
It was, however, with difficulty that Colonel
Walcot's companions could drag him from the
bridge.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
All dark.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Come along, Colonel," urged one; "you see
you were wrong after all.  There's not a thread
of a gleam anywhere.  Eh! see, 'tis all as dark as
pitch."
</p>

<p>
"Ay," sighed Walcot, slowly moving on at last,
"dark, dark enough."

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
IN THE MALT-YARD.
</h3>

<p>
The postern was still on the latch when
Ruth reached it.  Alas! she had
anticipated no less.  That it was locked,
was no longer one of her fears.  She
would have sooner her father had detected her
midnight flitting now, and come upon her face to
face.  Anything sooner than that he should have
been one of that terribly strange company.  All,
however, was still around and within.  Not even
the watch-dog uttered a sound, for he knew
her step, and fawned at her feet as she passed;
and safe and unseen by other eye than his she
reached the end of the corridor, casting a glance
as she stole across the floor at Maudlin, who to
all appearance had not stirred.
</p>

<p>
Safe at last in the shelter of her own room,
Ruth sank breathless and spent into a chair and,
overcome by the fatigue and excitement of the
long day's pleasures and pains, she fell into
what must have been a sort of long fainting
unconsciousness, or else it was real honest sleep
that stole upon her unawares.
</p>

<p>
All she ever knew of it was, that when she
opened her eyes again the sunbeams were flooding
her room, and the gatehouse clock chiming.  Six
it must have been, since outside in the malting-yard
she could hear the stir and voices of the
men getting to their work.  Pressing her chilled
fingers upon her aching eyelids, she gazed round,
striving to collect her dazed senses; and the
events of the past night, as they came back to
her mind, seemed like some bad dream.  She sat
up and threw back the heavy cloak still covering
her shoulders with an impatient hand, as if she
would have thrust the ugly fancies away with it; but
a sudden clash and clatter at her feet recalled her
thoroughly to herself, and she started up in dismay.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Ruth's waking resolutions.
</span>
</p>

<p>
It was caused by the falling of the steel blade
which her sudden movement had displaced from
the folds of her cloak; there, glittering dazzlingly
bright in the sunshine, it lay upon the floor.
</p>

<p>
Spell-bound, Ruth gazed at it, much in the
way that people are forced, in spite of themselves,
to stare at some poisonous brilliant-eyed reptile
crossing their path.  Yet this was not altogether
Ruth's case.  If anyone could have looked into her
face then they would have seen in it no vacant,
helpless stare, but a dawning, deep thoughtfulness,
whose perplexity yielded gradually to an expression
of strong determination, as though she had
come to a decision on some knotty point she had
been discussing with herself.
</p>

<p>
Only the clock, however, striking seven roused
her from her abstraction.  So late! and
approaching the window she opened its panes and let in
the pure morning air.  Then she proceeded to
make a fresh toilette.  With a little sigh yesterday's
gay tiffany was laid aside, poor, crumpled,
bedraggled stuff that it all looked now, and she
put on a gown of gray camlet, from beneath whose
skirts, just reaching to her ankles, peeped forth
a pair of little feet, in a pair of stout plain
black leathern tagged shoes; just the very things
for rough country roads and boggy lanes.  The
neat-fitting bodice was finished by a kerchief of
spotless lawn gathered close about her neck, and
though fashionable ladies would no doubt have
vowed it an odiously grand-mothery sort of thing,
it was none so unbecoming.  Indeed as Ruth
proceeded to fasten that black silk caped hood
beneath her little round chin, it was quite a
matter of nice taste, whether Queen Ruth, rosy as
her regal robes and crown, and bright as her gay
dancing glances could make her, or this demure,
pale little Ruth, clad in sober gray, and with
great wistful eyes, somewhat heavily shadowed,
indeed, with purple lines, were the prettier.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A morning visit.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Small doubt of Master Rumbold's opinion on
the matter did there seem to be, when ready
equipped, even to a large basket upon her arm,
she stood before him with the black jack of ale,
that always made his breakfast.  "Now thou
look'st thyself, Ruth," he said, his brooding brow
lightening as he gazed at her.  "Why dost thou
sigh, child?" he went on, taking the jack and
putting it to his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Did I sigh, father?" and all unconsciously
poor Ruth sighed again, for never in her life had
it seemed to her that she had felt less herself.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, didst thou.  Well, well.  Thou'rt thy
father's own daughter now: kiss me then," he
went on, setting down the empty jack and wiping
his lips.  "And where art thou bound for so
early?" he added.
</p>

<p>
"Nether Hall, father."
</p>

<p>
"Nether Hall! why, 'tis but a round o' the
clock that thou wert there," he said, opening his
one eye more in surprise than displeasure.
</p>

<p>
"Madam Lee," began Ruth rather hesitatingly,
and blushing, though she scarcely knew why, for
it was but pure and simple truth she was speaking,
"Madam Lee promised me a sitting of the
white bantam hen's eggs yesterday, if&mdash;if," and
she glanced down at her basket, "I liked to go
and fetch them."
</p>

<p>
"And are the white bantam's eggs as big as
the giant bird's in the fairy tale, that you must
be taking a basket for them half as big as yourself?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, father.  But Madam Lee promised me
also some choice green goose&mdash;goose&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The maltster in better humour.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"'Tis Madam Lee is the goose to be spoiling
thee so," smiled Rumbold good-humouredly.  "She
always is promising thee some fine thing or
another.  Well, well, go thy ways then, Ruth, for
the green gooseberries, and a pleasant walk, and
if by hap thou shouldst chance across Lawrence
Lee,&mdash;and 'tis possible that, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, father."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A proposed message.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Tell him to&mdash;but yet,&mdash;no.  Tell him naught;
'twill keep.  I shall be seeing him shortly."  And
then Rumbold turned in at a door of the corn
chambers.

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br><br>
THE MEETING ON THE FOOT-BRIDGE.
</h3>

<p>
Taking a short cut round by the moat,
and crossing the stile above the King's
Arms, Ruth soon gained the river towing-path.
</p>

<p>
As the sights and sounds of the new day greeted
her, she felt a little cheered.  One must have
been wretched indeed not to have found an agreeable
distraction in the blithe bird chorus overhead,
and the buzzing of the insects in the young grass
studded with the early summer flowers, whose
brilliant hues mirrored themselves in the clear
water rippling up into tiny bays to her very feet.
</p>

<p>
What a bright merry world it was!  How hard
to think that it had in it any such thing as
sorrow, or sin, or cruelty, or&mdash;and ere the shadow of
the sad word could flit across her thoughts, a
butterfly fell at her feet, and fluttering its poor
bruised wings for a moment, lay motionless on the
flinty path.
</p>

<p>
It was quite dead; and Ruth bent down, and
gently placing it on a fresh young dock-leaf, laid
it beneath a whitethorn bush, well hidden from
all tread of hob-nailed shoes and ruthless
plough-boy fingers; and leaving the soft west wind
sweeping low through the sedge, to sigh it a dirge,
she pursued her way, till a turn of the path
brought her within sound of rushing water, and
in a few minutes she reached a rough foot-bridge
composed of one plank with a hand-rail of
hazel-bough, which was thrown across a little
rivulet, thickly screened at its furthermost end
by a copse of elder and hazel bushes.  Into this
cool retreat a posse of old mother sheep had
penetrated with their lambs, and lay in soft white
heaps down to the water's very brink, not in the
least put about at the apparition of Ruth, as she
came to a standstill in the middle of the bridge
to watch the pranks of the lambs with a half
amused, half absent smile.
</p>

<p>
So absorbed was she, that the touch of a hand
laid ever so gently on her shoulder caused her to
start with surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Lawrence!" she exclaimed, for he it was.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, Lawrence!" he answered; "and good-morrow
to you, Ruth!  Were you coming to the Hall?"
</p>

<p>
She nodded.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Lawrence Lee prevaricates.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"To be sure then," he went on, "some good
angel brought me by the copse, instead of going
round by the weir, for in that case I should have
missed you."
</p>

<p>
"And where were you going?" asked she.
</p>

<p>
"Waltham," he replied, after a momentary hesitation.
</p>

<p>
"But this is not the way to Waltham."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, is it not?" he said, with well-assumed
carelessness; "all the same, I am right glad I
came it, since I have met you upon it, Ruth
dear."
</p>

<p>
"That is fine talking," pouted Ruth; "but
you're not telling me the truth, Lawrence.  You
weren't going to Waltham."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Sharp words.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Wasn't I?" returned the young man, flushing
a little.  "Well, look here, my dear, people who
ask no questions, hear no lies.  I doubt I may go
where I list, without Mistress Ruth Rumbold's
leave," and then he made a pretence of being about
to stalk on; but the attempt was a sorry failure,
breaking down instantly as he saw the tears brimming
up into the eyes so persistently fixed on the
silly lambs.  "Ruth," he whispered, as in a
moment he was beside her again; and taking her
chin in his hands, he turned her face up to his,
"come, let's kiss and be friends.  Eh, shall we?
You know I'd not vex you for&mdash;for&mdash;a king's
ransom.  Indeed I did not mean to vex you, only&mdash;there,
it was so plaguy inquisitive of you, don't
you know, to&mdash;there, never mind; what have you
got in this basket?" concluded he, turning the
conversation, like the wise diplomatist he thought
himself.
</p>

<p>
"Now who's inquisitive, I wonder?" cried Ruth,
folding her arms tight down upon the lid of the
basket, and breaking into a saucy smile, which,
however, faded in an instant.  "Lawrence, where
were you going?  Tell me, dear."
</p>

<p>
"If you'll tell me what you've got in that
basket, perhaps I may," laughed he.  "Come, is it
a bargain, Mistress Pry?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mr. Pry."
</p>

<p>
"To Hoddesdon, then.  There, I hope you're
happier for the information."
</p>

<p>
"Not happier; no, Lawrence," she answered
very slowly.  "Wait a bit now," she went on, as
he laid aggressive hands on the basket.  "To
Hoddesdon!  What for?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come now, that's not in the bond.  Why,
nothing; nothing, little woman, that you know
anything about."
</p>

<p>
"But I want to know," insisted she, still
valiantly protecting the basket's most vulnerable
points; "that's just it, I want to know."
</p>

<p>
"Then want must be your master," he said
angrily.  "Little girls must not know everything,"
he added, mending his rude speech, and seizing
basket, and Ruth, and all in his arms.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not a little girl any longer," she cried,
struggling to free herself, and digging her pink
nails ever so hard into his bronzed wrists, till he
decided to loosen his hold.
</p>

<p>
"No, you're a little wild kitten, with the sharpest
claws in the world; that's what you are," he
said; "but it won't do, I'm master."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A bitter secret.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"'Tis no good you're going to Hoddesdon for,"
she said bluntly, looking up into his laughing
eyes, "or you'd tell me when I ask you, without
all this silly nonsense.  You never kept a secret
from me before, Lawrence."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I never had one to keep."
</p>

<p>
"But now?"
</p>

<p>
"Hang it! you'd try a saint's temper," growled
he, wrinkling his brows into a most unsanctified
frown, and letting her go with such a sudden
abruptness that she stumbled a little, and in the
effort to maintain her footing on the narrow plank
the basket slipped from her arm, and would have
fallen into the water had not Lee caught it, with
a dexterous turn of his wrist.
</p>

<p>
"See now, Ruth," he said, as he restored it to
her, his eye grown radiant again in his pride at
his clever legerdemain, "if you're not at my mercy
after all.  Might I not have been revenged for
your refusal, and helped myself to a peep into this
mighty particular basket, if I wasn't honour bright
from top to toe?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The mysterious basket.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"But you are, Lawrence, aren't you?" challenged
she, with a strange earnestness, that sent his eyes,
which were gazing into hers, back to the basket;
"and evil be to him who evil thinks," she went on.
"And&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, plague take it!" he interrupted impatiently;
"what are you driving at?  Now for the basket.
Come."
</p>

<p>
"You really care to see inside it?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a straw, my dear child," he said loftily.
"'Tis full of emptiness, I daresay.  That's just
what delights you girls more than anything;
teasing and tantalizing a fellow all about nothing."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, but there is something in it.  Something
I was bringing to the Hall on purpose to show
you, and&mdash;and to ask your opinion about.  And
yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;" she went on wistfully, "I hope
you won't be able to&mdash;to give me one."
</p>

<p>
"Why, my dear girl," rejoined he with a superior
smile, "how mighty mysterious we are, to be
sure!"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a fearful-looking thing, let me tell you,"
she said, gingerly raising one corner of her basket
lid.
</p>

<p>
"Some queer fish, is it?&mdash;out of the river?" he
asked eagerly, for he was a mighty fisherman.
</p>

<p>
"Out of the river," nodded she.
</p>

<p>
"A pike of some sort perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I should say, of some sort."
</p>

<p>
"You dear, splendid, diamond of a girl," ecstatically
cried Lawrence, "as I live 'tis a pike! can't
I see it gleaming?" and he clutched at the
concealing hay&mdash;"a big silver pike!"
</p>

<p>
"No, a steel one," she said, as the weapon lay
exposed in all its nakedness, and steadily she lifted
her eyes to his face.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Found out.
</span>
</p>

<p>
It had grown ashen white, and he staggered
back for support against the bridge rail.  "Ruth!"
he gasped, as the handful of hay dropped from
his powerless fingers and floated away on the
swirl of the stream, "what is the meaning of this?"
</p>

<p>
"That you must tell me, Lawrence."
</p>

<p>
"Where did you find it?" he went on.
</p>

<p>
"In the river.  The river Lea.  Close by the
water steps in Mistress Sheppard's garden.  And
when?  Last night, while you were in the King's
Arms, talking to those men.  The men," she went
on in steady tones, though he was biting his lip,
and his pale face flushed painfully, "who were
there; instead of going straight home, as you
ought to have done&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ought!" angrily interrupted he; "and who
made you spy over me?"
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't spying.  I was only&mdash;taking a peep,
just a little peep at&mdash;at the boat."
</p>

<p>
"Boat?"
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Queen Ruth</i>," Lawrence dear.
</p>

<p>
"And since you set such store by honour bright
and 'oughts,' and all that sort of thing all at
once, what business had you to be abroad all in
the dark when your father had bidden you go
indoors?"
</p>

<p>
She coloured a little.  "I did go in," she
answered after a moment's silence.  "Only&mdash;only&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Only you came out again, that's all," he said
with a low mocking laugh.  "Ruth, Ruth! what
possessed you to do such a thing?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Changed indeed.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"I was ill at ease, Lawrence," she said, colouring
deeper still.  "I feared&mdash;nay, I do not know
what I feared.  But I could not stay in the house.
Its air stifled me.  I could not breathe.  I thought&mdash;I
fancied&mdash;nay, something has seemed so amiss
with everything&mdash;with father and you, Lawrence,
with you for these long, long weeks past.  I have
fancied&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Psha!  Fancies indeed!" he cried with an
impatient twitch of his lips, and turning from
her, he stood and gazed with lack-lustre eyes into
the water.
</p>

<p>
"And you're not a bit like the old Lawrence.
And all day yesterday you&mdash;never mind.  Lawrence,
what do those dreadful men want here?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The bayonet.
</span>
</p>

<p>
He turned his face and gazed broodingly into
hers, following the direction of her eyes as they
fell again on the contents of the basket.  "Bringing
their horrid&mdash;what is the thing called?"
</p>

<p>
"A bayonet," he answered curtly.
</p>

<p>
"Their horrid bayonets here; and dropping
them all over the place?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said with a faint smile, "they didn't
do that purposely, be sure.  'Twas an accident.
A stupid, infernal&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Lawrence!  Fie, now!  For shame, sir!"
and Ruth's little hand shut up his lips.
</p>

<p>
"An awkward little mistake, then," he went on,
"of that clod-hopping&mdash;never mind names, Ruth."
</p>

<p>
"Rumsey," said Ruth; "I heard father call
him so&mdash;Colonel Rumsey."

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br><br>
"HE DIED FOR HIS KING."
</h3>

<p>
"Hush!" whispered Lawrence, gripping
her fast by the arm, and looking
hurriedly round.  "And&mdash;well, what
more did you hear?  Tell me the
truth now."
</p>

<p>
"Lawrence," she said, timorously following his
glance, "I want to tell it you.  But 'twas all such
a confusion.  Just a word here and there; yet,
oh, Lawrence! such fearful ones; of their own evil
ways, and of&mdash;of killing&mdash;of killing!  Oh! shake
your head if you like; but they did, I tell you.
And then some one said something about&mdash;think,
Lawrence&mdash;about the king."
</p>

<p>
"Ay?"
</p>

<p>
"And of laying him low upon his own highway.
Think of it;" and Ruth shivered in the
bright sunshine.
</p>

<p>
"They were full, it seems, of their merry jests,
these roystering gentlemen," said Lee.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, I like not such jests; and I'd not have
you joining in them, nor my father neither," she
said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! but he's their arch-jester," cynically
laughed Lawrence.  "We're a merry company,
we boys, my dear."
</p>

<p>
But there was little enough of mirth in the
young man's face, as he stood there gazing across
the level meadows, and up at the sailing clouds,
and in fact everywhere excepting into the clear,
earnest eyes of his companion as she came near
and laid her hand gently on his arm.  "Lawrence,
you bid me speak truth just now," she said, "and
to my best I did; for I would scorn to tell a lie,
and least of all to you.  But it is not so you are
serving me, sir, your old, old friend Ruth.  You
are hiding something from me.  Oh! but you are.
Something that troubles you; and that is not
kind of you."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Sad jesting.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Least said, soonest mended," he said, but in
softened tones, and gently withdrawing his arm
from her grasp.  "There are things done in this
world not good for such as you are to be told about,
Ruth dear.  Tell me," he added, pointing to the
basket, "does your father know anything of all
this?"
</p>

<p>
"No; I lacked the courage to anger him when
he looked so kindly on me this morning; and
besides, I&mdash;well, I thought first I would speak
with you about it, Lawrence."
</p>

<p>
"That is well," answered Lee; "and for thy
life, Ruth, do not tell him.  Do you
understand&mdash;eh?  It would be betraying such&mdash;such
terrible tales of these eavesdroppings of yours,
letting such naughty cats out of bags.  Eh?
wouldn't it, now?  Do not tell a single soul; do
you hear, child?" and he gripped her by the arm
till his fingers left their marks on it.  "Promise.
'Tis of course but a mere trifle," he went on with
ill-feigned unconcern.  "Not worth our wasting
our breath upon.  But still, if I were in your
place I'd tell nobody.  Not a soul, dear heart!
Eh?"
</p>

<p>
"That is as it may be," demurely answered she.
</p>

<p>
"But I command!" he cried sternly.  "I forbid
you to do it, do you hear?  I'll have no conditions."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, but I will," she said, resolutely setting her
lips.
</p>

<p>
"Ruth, child!  Ruth!" he said in the agony of
his desperation; "you don't know what you're
saying.  'Tis playing with fire&mdash;with edged
tools."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, indeed," she said, with another glance at
the bayonet.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a matter of life and death."
</p>

<p>
"And yet this moment you called it a silly
trifle," she said, lifting her eyes reproachfully to
his flushed face.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Startling truths.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Death!  Do you want to drive me mad?"
he cried through his clenching teeth.  "I tell you,
girl, if your foolish, gossiping tongue should let
slip one syllable of what you saw and overheard
last night, it would be a hanging matter for your
father and for me."
</p>

<p>
"Lawrence, Lawrence!" gasped the terrified
girl; "why? what for?"
</p>

<p>
"What for?" echoed he with heaving breast
"Do you know what this disobedience of yours
has done?&mdash;undone, I mean.  Shall I tell you?"
</p>

<p>
"Lawrence! what, what?"
</p>

<p>
"The good of a whole nation.  That is what
these gentlemen and your father&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And you, Lawrence?" interrupted she.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The shadow of a plot.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Ay, I suppose so;" and his voice fell slightly.
"That is what we were plot&mdash;arranging."
</p>

<p>
"And to be hanged for doing so much good?
Oh! no, no.  His majesty would never allow
that," said Ruth with an incredulous shake of her
head.  "He is so generous, so kind!  Why do you
shiver like that? and how dare you shake your
head?  I say the king is&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hold your peace, child!  You don't know what
you're talking about.  'Tis just Charles who has
to be&mdash;to be got rid of."
</p>

<p>
"Got rid of?" gasped Ruth.  "How&mdash;what&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, we have not got so far yet as that.
Maybe he'll have to be shipped across channel,
or&mdash;yes, put in some safe place."
</p>

<p>
"Prison?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, now, you're such a downright one!"
winced Lawrence petulantly.  "Well, prison,
then, if you like.  Words break no bones."
</p>

<p>
"But deeds cut off heads!" sobbingly burst
forth Ruth.  "That's how they served our
martyred king."
</p>

<p>
"Psha!  Martyred!" sneered Lawrence.
</p>

<p>
"First they put him in prison, and then they
murdered him."
</p>

<p>
"Well, make your mind easy, child," said
Lawrence.  "That's not the plan this time anyhow.
'Tis quite a different sort of one."
</p>

<p>
"Then there is a pian?"
</p>

<p>
"Something of one; though hang me if I can
make head or tail of it!" he said wearily.  "They
jangle over it so.  One's for this way, and one for
that."
</p>

<p>
"And you, Lawrence?"
</p>

<p>
"I serve but to count with, child.  Master
Rumbold would have me in it," he said with a
shrug.
</p>

<p>
"And after some poor fashion he has you; but
not your heart, I doubt," said Ruth.
</p>

<p>
"Nay; perhaps I had not it to spare," he said,
gazing down with rather a sad smile at her sweet,
attent face, which was brightening a little; "and if
I consented to be one of their lot, it was but to
keep friends with him."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A little royalist.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"'Twould have been more friendly of you to
have been his enemy," sighed Ruth.  "Had he
asked such a thing of me, I would have defied him.
Ay, but I would, Lawrence.  Mayhap an 'I'll
turn no such traitor, Master Rumbold!' from you,
Lawrence, would have saved him from this falling
back into the old terrible ways.  When I think,"
shudderingly went on Ruth, "that my father&mdash;my
kind, loving father, who calls me ladybird, and
such sweet, merry names&mdash;was the same who
stood guard by King Charles's block, and looked
on while his bleeding head fell, it makes me dream
such dreadful dreams that I start up screaming
in my sleep.  Lawrence, I would you had defied
him."
</p>

<p>
"He would never have spoken to me again,
Ruth, if I had," answered the young man; "and
he would have forbidden me ever to see you, or
speak to you again."
</p>

<p>
She was silent for a few moments.  "And
better so," she said at last.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A traitor or patriot?
</span>
</p>

<p>
"You wouldn't mind, Ruth," he said bitterly.
"It wouldn't matter a scrap to you if you never
saw me again.  I know that;" and he turned
away.
</p>

<p>
"It would matter very much," she answered.
"I think my life&mdash;my outside life&mdash;would feel
like this little stream here, when the winter
comes, and the flowers and the sunshine are all
gone&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Dear child!  Dear Ruth!"
</p>

<p>
"But," she went on, gently pushing away the
hands he was stretching out to her&mdash;"but still
in my heart there would have been sunshine;
because I could have thought of Lawrence Lee as
an honourable man, and not as a traitor.  What
would Madam Lee think of you, Lawrence, if
she knew this that I know?"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" he murmured, closing his eyes and
knitting his brows.
</p>

<p>
"And your father," she went on; "he was of no
such poor flimsy stuff.  He died for his king;
true to the death."
</p>

<p>
"He believed in him," said Lawrence.  "For
my part&mdash;well, I speak as I hear, Ruth.  His
worst enemies never denied Charles the First had
his good points; but the best friends of Charles
the Second say 'tis difficult to find his; and as for
his faults, he's as full of them as&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"As you are, or any other mortal man.  Come,
tell me, you silly boy, you, do you think that if
these gentlemen&mdash;these fine 'friends' of yours,
who want to be rid, as you call it, of His
Majesty&mdash;were ruling England in his place, the country
would fare happier?  For my part," went on
Ruth, when no response from Lawrence appeared
to be forthcoming, "I doubt my father would
make a rare stern tyrant.  And as for you,
Lawrence&mdash;" but something in this notion suddenly
upset all Ruth's sober eloquence, and it rippled
away in a peal of merry laughter.
</p>

<p>
"I see nothing ludicrous in it," said Lawrence
grimly.
</p>

<p>
"No indeed," said Ruth, regaining her gravity,
"'tis no laughing matter."
</p>

<p>
"Come, Ruth, if you have quite done your
sermonizing, let us part friends at least."
</p>

<p>
"That is at an end," she said, settling her
disarranged hood, and, drawing the handles of her
basket well up to her elbow, she turned her face
homewards.
</p>

<p>
"But you were going to the Hall?" he said.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Parting in sorrow.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"I was," she replied; "but I cannot face
Madam Lee and think what you have become.  Fare
you well, Lawrence!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, silly child! what should you know about
politics?  This comes, now, of meddling in things
you don't understand," he said fractiously
</p>

<p>
"'Tis not I who have meddled with them," she
said; "and I would give my gold and garnet brooch
they had not come within a hundred miles of
Stanstead."
</p>

<p>
"Psha!  Go your foolish, obstinate ways, then,
Ruth.  Stay, first give me the basket."
</p>

<p>
"Give it you?  Well, well," she went on;
"now I think of it, 'tis yours, I suppose.  For old
Diggory, your gardener, brought it over last week
full of early potatoes&mdash;a present for father from
Madam Lee.  So take it, if you'll be troubled
with it;" and, first extracting its contents, she
handed it to Lee.
</p>

<p>
He dashed it furiously into the stream, sending
the terrified sheep stampeding in all directions.
</p>

<p>
"This is too much," he said; "'twas the weapon
I meant."
</p>

<p>
"That is not mine to give; and were it mine a
million times over, I would not give it you.  The
deadly hateful thing; unless&mdash;" and taking it by
its short handle, she laid its point to her heart.
</p>

<p>
"Mad girl!" he cried in agonizing amazement;
"what would you do?  Give it me.  Do you hear?"
and he started forward to seize it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Ruth's threat.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Mind, Lawrence," she said, waving him back,
"dare to lay a finger on it, and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;what&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"And I will tell all the world&mdash;that is to say,
I will tell Mistress Sheppard, and that will serve
just as well, of everything I heard and saw last
night.  Say, Lawrence," and she half held the
bayonet towards him, "which way is to be?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Lawrence Lee in check.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Without a word he turned from her, and strode
wrathfully, and pale as a ghost, away through the
copse.

CHAPTER XII.
<br><br>
MOTHER GOOSE'S TALES.
</h3>

<p>
Lovelier spring than this one now
passing into early summer had not been
within living memory.  Never had the
trees budded more green and fresh-looking,
and the roses and larkspurs shown more
hurry to break forth and mingle their fragrance
with the breath of the soft sweet air; and yet
Ruth Rumbold's heart felt as wintry as if some
load of ice-bound earth weighed it down.
</p>

<p>
Poor old Maudlin wondered sorely what ailed
her pet, that she went about the place, doing her
little household duties as carefully and deftly
indeed as she always did do them, but not to the
tune of her own sweet young voice, as her wont
was.  No, the child had grown silent as any stock
and stone, and as grave&mdash;and that wasn't saying
a little neither&mdash;as the master himself; and then
Maudlin set about concocting a variety of messes
and electuaries in the still-room with a view to
restoring the roses to the pale cheeks, and charming
back the lost music.  And then, after all her
trouble, to think that Ruth refused to swallow
a mouthful of her medicaments, and vowed that
nothing ailed her&mdash;if only Maudlin would leave
her to herself!
</p>

<p>
For three whole days this sort of thing has been
going on; and to-night, tired out with her ineffectual
expostulations, the old woman has gone off,
not without dudgeon, to "get a mouthful of fresh
air," as she says.  And truly the atmosphere is
heavy&mdash;as if a storm were not so far off&mdash;and to
indulge in a little interchange of ideas in the
gate-house parlour; for there you are always safe to
pick up the latest news stirring, trifling and
important, just as you would come upon it in the
Mall or the Covent Garden coffee-houses.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Ruth at her studies.
</span>
</p>

<p>
And so Ruth is left to her musings; for though
at the first glance you might call them studies,
since one book of the little heap piled up on the
broad ledge of the window where she is seated,
lies open on her lap, you have but to look again,
to see she is not reading it.
</p>

<p>
As, however, the sound of a heavy step descending
the stairs falls upon her ear, she drops her eyes
to the page, not even raising them again when the
maltster enters, and crossing slowly to her side,
stands gazing out absently into the rays of the
setting sun, which are luridly firing the yew-tree
peacock into a blaze of red and yellow.
</p>

<p>
Presently, however, he turned his eyes upon
Ruth.  "Does not the book please you?" he asked,
pointing to the volume before her.  "I see," he
went on, when she looked up, but made no answer,
"that you have not turned the page since you
opened it haphazard when I bid you be reading it
half an hour ago.  Or is it that the picture of the
blessed martyrdom of Mistress Anne Askew so
fascinates you?"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a fearful thing!" said Ruth, shuddering,
as she looked, for the first time, if truth must be
owned, at the pictured page.  "Poor Mistress
Askew!  She must have been a right brave lady."
</p>

<p>
"A bold Christian woman, rather," quickly
corrected the maltster, "who counted her life for
nought beside the truth."
</p>

<p>
"Truth is indeed a pure noble thing to live for,"
acquiesced Ruth.
</p>

<p>
"And to die for.  Yes," said Rumbold; "that
blessed work of Master Fox's is indeed a mighty
treasure-house of the scores who have shed their
blood for it."
</p>

<p>
"Ay," sighed Ruth, "'tis indeed a book of death,
and ghastliness, and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A batch of books.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"And wholesome teaching, and fitter far for thy
recreation moments than all this farrago of
chap-book trash I found you head over ears upon.
Where did you get it?"
</p>

<p>
"I bought it of the old packman who came to
the gatehouse yesterday morning; and a fine
collection there was in his wallet," continued Ruth,
her eyes waxing bright.  "He had come straight
by way of Bow and Waltham, and on here across
the Rye, from the 'Looking Glass,' the big
chap-bookseller's shop that stands on London Bridge,
father, dear, and he'd got <i>Reynard the Fox</i>, the
sly wicked creature.  Father, what an odious
hypocrite he was&mdash;eh?  And <i>Mother Bunch</i>, and <i>Jack
and the Giants</i>&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Fe!  Fi!  Fo!  Fum!<br>
  I smell the blood of an English&mdash;<i>mun</i>!<br>
  Let him be alive, or let him be dead,<br>
  I'll grind his bones&mdash;'"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Tut! tut! tut!" frowned the maltster.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The maltster hates romance.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"To make my bread!" went on Ruth, absorbed
in the vision of the valiant little Cornishman's
attack on the three-headed monster.  "Yes, and
then there was <i>Tarlton's Jests</i>," she hurried on,
all unconscious of the deepening frowns of
Rumbold, "and <i>Guy of Warwick</i>, and&mdash;let me see,
what came next?  Why, to be sure, 'twas the
<i>Blind Beggar's Daughter of Bethnal Green</i>&mdash;'Pretty
Bessee,' you know, father; and the history
of the <i>Two Children in the Wood</i>, poor pretty
dears! with a picture running all along atop of the page,
showing all the sad woes they suffered, and
ending up with the hanging of the cruel uncle.  And
then&mdash;well, I protest, there was such a heap, that
I cannot remember them half.  But I know he had
<i>John Barleycorn</i>, because&mdash;well, father, it made
me think"&mdash;and a merry smile rippled on Ruth's
mobile lips&mdash;"of somebody we know, eh? and how
they squeezed the poor old fellow to death.  And
then," chattered on Ruth, encouraged by the faint
smile that dawned on the maltster's stolid face,
"then there was <i>The World Turned Upside
Down</i>.  Well, I had half a mind for that; but
just then I came upon this, and it looked the very
best of all, and as I&mdash;"  Ruth hesitated to explain
that her resources had not reached to the purchase
of all the chap-books she had coveted, and the
thrilling woodcuts of the one she now held towards
him had carried the day with her.  "Well, 'twill
divert you, I'm sure, father, dear."
</p>

<p>
It was <i>The Seven Champions of Christendom</i>!
</p>

<p>
"Seven dunderheads!" frowned Rumbold, turning
the book's pages with a contemptuous finger.
"Harkye, Ruth," he continued, in stern tones,
"not a groat more of pocket-money will I waste
on you till you have learned to spend it something
more discreetly than on trash like this.  I had
rather see my money at the bottom of the moat
than frittered so.  Pah! dragons, forsooth, and
fair captive ladies! and knights-errant, and
saints&mdash;beshrew them, all!  Mighty saints, I'll warrant
me they were.  Pagans in motley!  Saint David
of Scotland.  If he set foot there now the
presbytery would be for hanging him high as Holyrood
tower.  And Saint Patrick of Ireland, with his
superstitious shamrock symbol, and Saint George
of England."
</p>

<p>
"Merry England, father," corrected Ruth.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A burning shame.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Pah! pish! a seemly time this for England to
be merry! when she needs bow her head even to
the dust for the weight of her sins!" and he turned
and threw the book angrily into the fire.  "That
for your chap-book saints!"
</p>

<p>
"Now," thought poor Ruth, "he would be as
cruel to them, if they were real flesh and blood
men, as ever Bishop Bonner and Queen Mary were
to the poor Protestant martyrs;" and silently, for
she dared not trust herself to speak, she began to
turn the pages of the volume on her knee; but
Rumbold took it from her.
</p>

<p>
"Read no more," he said, "till your spirit is
better attuned to such profitable instruction.  Lay
it by till to-morrow," he went on, in less harsh
tones; "mayhap when you have slept on what
you have read, and digested it&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I doubt I shall not do that," despairingly
answered Ruth, "for the woodcuts alone would serve
to give bolder hearts than mine a nightmare."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A soft place in his heart.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"And yet," went on Rumbold, softening still
more at the notion that his favourite reading had
impressed Ruth more strongly than he had at first
assumed, "I do not think yours is lacking in
courage.  Your father's daughter would dare much
in a righteous cause were she called upon to do it.
Eh, Ruth?"
</p>

<p>
She did not answer; but sat gazing dreamily
at the fire as it reduced the poor chap-book to a
few filmy shreds.  "But now, little one," went on
the maltster, "to your room.  Good-night!" and
he bent and kissed her forehead,
</p>

<p>
"Nay, father!" she rejoined, looking up in surprise;
"not good-night yet awhile.  'Tis hours too
early."
</p>

<p>
"I like not thy trick of exaggerating," rebukefully
said he.  "One hour, and barely, for the clock
has already struck seven&mdash;it may be sooner&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed," briskly interrupted she, "and I
am not for going to sleep at sunset, with the little
chits of sparrows&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Cross-questioning.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"And magpies!  You grow pert, mistress.
Come!" sternly added Rumbold, "I'll have no
more of the May-day wantonness we wot of.  Do
as I bid you."
</p>

<p>
"But, father&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do you hear me?" thundered the maltster.  "I
desire to be alone.  That is&mdash;I need not your company."
</p>

<p>
"'Twill be so lonesome for you," said Ruth; "I
think it would have cheered you in this twilight
time if&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I need it not, I tell you," quickly interrupted
Rumbold.  "I expect&mdash;visitors," and he coughed
huskily.
</p>

<p>
"Visitors!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay; that is to say," stammered Rumbold, "it&mdash;it
is possible."
</p>

<p>
"Visitors! and nothing prepared for them to
eat!" cried the little housemistress aghast.
</p>

<p>
"They are not of the sort who set store by
rich meats and costly wine-bibbing.  They come&mdash;to
confer with me, on&mdash;on important questions."
</p>

<p>
"Is it the price of grain, father?  I heard Parson
Alsides saying to Master Lockit only this very
morning that it was at a most ruinous price&mdash;seventy
shillings a quarter, he said; and that if the
farmers and the employers&mdash;such as you, father,
dear, and Lawrence Lee, I suppose, would but put
their heads together to devise how it could be
cheapened for the poor, 'twould be, he said, a right
blessed day's work, and a vast deal better than
the hatching of all sorts of plots, and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Eh! eh! eh!  Parson Alsides is a chattering old
sycophant, who is always prating for the pensions
he gets out of the king's own privy purse.  Though,
mind you, child, I don't say I would not spare the
matter consideration when more serious concerns
allow me leisure."
</p>

<p>
"I hoped you had done with those for ever,
father," said Ruth gravely; "'twas a serious
concern, indeed, when poor King Charles was killed,
and you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I! how now?" cried Rumbold, turning sharply
upon her.  "What had I to do with that?"
</p>

<p>
"What had you not, father?" said Ruth, in tones
of sturdy reproach.  "Why, many's the time
Maudlin has told me how you stood by and saw
it done."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A bitter-sweet story.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"And beshrew her chattering old tongue for her
pains!  I'd have had it cut out, had I caught her
at her tales.  'Tis no fit one for your ears, Ruth,"
he added, in sad slow tones.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, father; I could always stop them with
my fingers when she begins about it; and yet
still I must listen.  'Tis such a bitter-sweet
story&mdash;poor king!"
</p>

<p>
"And yet," went on Rumbold, changing his
mood, "after all, why should I be sorry to think
that you know your father can look his duty in
the face."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, father!" she began reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
"Let be, child," he interrupted, turning away,
and thrusting his hands gloomily down into his
pockets, "'Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do,'
saith the Scripture, 'do it with all thy
might.'  'Tis enough."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, indeed enough," said Ruth, stealing
beside him, "and you will meddle no more in
such things, eh, father?"
</p>

<p>
"And who told you I dreamed of doing so?"
he demanded in unsteady and excited tones.
</p>

<p>
"You must rest and be comfortable," went on
Ruth, twining her arms about his neck, and stroking
his rugged face; "so snug here, isn't it, in our
beautiful old Rye House?  And you must be
content to rest now, and have your little Ruth
take care of you, and sing&mdash;for you say I have a
tuneful voice, eh, dear&mdash;of the Land 'where the
wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are
at rest,' and the gentle green pastures, and the
godly hymns you taught me when I was a small
thing you could dandle on your knee.  Promise
me, dear heart," she went on coaxingly, when
Rumbold's only answer was an attempt to shake
her off, "never to meddle more.  Let the bad
cruel-hearted men make their plots, for 'tis all
their wits can reach to, I doubt.  But for one like
you, who can make such malt as is not to be
found besides in all Hertfordshire, oh, I'd stick
to it."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Rumbold's changes of mood.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"And stick you to your churn and your wheel,
Mistress Oracle," said the maltster, fondly stroking
her soft brown hair, "and discourse not so glibly
of what you do not understand a whit more than
your own frisky Tab there, who is tearing up
your fine chap-books with her claws.  What should
kings, and such kittle cattle's doings be to you?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Words about majesty.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Nay, little enough," said Ruth, turning to
rescue her precious books, and taking the destructive
Tab in her arms, "though in truth sometimes
I think I should like to see our King Charles,"
she went on, dreamily twiddling the kitten's ears.
</p>

<p>
"Have you not seen him many a time, silly
child?" said Rumbold.
</p>

<p>
"In a fashion, ay, yes, as he has ridden by yonder
in his coach, and his Grace of York too of course,
but 'tis such a glimpse; just enough to set one
caring to look him face to face.  Have you ever
done that, father?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;yes&mdash;I scarcely know," frowned Rumbold.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a right kind merry face, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"I see no such things in it," growled Rumbold;
"an ordinary swarthy one enough to my thinking."
</p>

<p>
"Yet Goodman Speedwell, when he went up
to London last year to sell his pigs, said 'twas a
rare and gracious one, and a pure fine sight to
see him playing with his little dogs in Saint
James's Park, and feeding the ducks in the canal
with his own royal hands.  Oh, he must be a
pleasant-humoured gentleman!"
</p>

<p>
"He's just a mortal man, I take it, very mortal,
and when he's angered spares none, for all his fine
forgetting and forgiving talk."
</p>

<p>
"There it is," said Ruth, "'tis scarce to be
expected that he who has been so wronged, should
be so forgiving as the Bible would have us.  Nowadays,
if a man sin against his brother, and kings
are our brothers, eh, father? in a fashion of speaking
they are our elder brothers, eh, father, dear?"
</p>

<p>
"Beshrew thee, child," impatiently frowned the
maltster, "what has come to you?"
</p>

<p>
"I say 'tis a stretch if that man shall be
forgiven twice, that is what I am thinking of; and
those who plotted the killing of Charles the First,
and were pardoned, would scarce be let go a
second time, if&mdash;if&mdash;" she faltered, and coloured
deeply.
</p>

<p>
"If what, mistress?" sternly challenged Rumbold.
</p>

<p>
"If they should harbour ill thoughts against
Charles the Second."
</p>

<p>
It was the maltster's turn to look aside, as she
lifted her appealing eyes to his face.  "Come,
come," he said, "a truce to this silly chatter.
Good-night; and hark you, give me the key of
the communicating door between your chamber
and the Warder's Room.  Have it you about you?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The key of the warder's room.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Yes, father; here," and she disengaged one of
the keys from the bunch hanging at her girdle,
and handed it to him, wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
"Very good," he said, taking it from her and
pocketing it, "'tis your own fault, for your
carelessness, Ruth," he went on; "this morning was
the second time I found that door ajar.  If I find
it so ever again, I'll have it walled up.  For the
present I'll hold the key in my keeping."
</p>

<p>
"But, father," protested Ruth, "Adam Lockit&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Adam Lockit grows stupid and deaf, and
Diggles is but one remove from an idiot, and the
arrantest coward breathing."
</p>

<p>
"Only about ghosts, father; you should see
him lay about him with the cudgels on double
his size in flesh and blood.  And he's keen as any
hare for the slightest sound or stir."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
An abrumpt "good-night."
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" said the maltster, "flibbertigibbets,
all should be abed and snoring by nine o' the
clock.  So good-night, child, and pleasant dreams."
And with another kiss, Rumbold dismissed his
daughter.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br><br>
THE SLIDING PANEL.
</h3>

<p>
The Warder's Room was an excellent
example of the famous rule that no
stronghold is stronger than its weakest
part.  Its three outer walls, the one
namely terminating the wing, the blind one giving
upon the pleasaunce, and the one overlooking the
moat, seemed stout enough to defy the teeth of
Old Time himself; but the partition wall dividing
it from Ruth's chamber beyond, was by comparison
a mere piece of pie-crust, though pie-crust of
perhaps rather a tough sort, inasmuch as its
panellings were composed of oak of no mean thickness.
</p>

<p>
Here and there, however, whether simply from
age, or whether the water-rats infesting the moat
below were answerable for any share in the
mischief, it was certain the wood showed signs of
decay; and one day when Ruth was dusting and
polishing the richly carved panels, as it was her
pride to do, one large square of them fairly gave
way, and fell inwards behind the skirting board.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A hiding place.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Groping with both hands to recover it, Ruth
found to her astonishment, that, instead of coming,
as she expected, into contact with the corresponding
panelling of the room beyond, they strayed
off into space, and on closer examination of the
framework of the fallen panel, she found that it
was grooved.  Surely it looked vastly as if she
had come upon one of the sliding panels old Adam
Lockit declared the house was full of!  Very like
it indeed, Ruth thought as she kindled a light
with her tinder-box, and stepping with it into the
pitch-dark cavity, looked round.
</p>

<p>
Barely high enough for her to stand upright
in, it evidently extended on each side of the
opening, to the stone and brickwork supports of the
arched communicating door, of which as we have
already seen Richard Rumbold secured the key
into his own keeping.  Thus the opening formed
a dark passage of nearly a couple of feet wide,
and six or seven feet long.
</p>

<p>
While she was occupied in these investigations
a sudden hustling, shuffling sound in the room
beyond, ordinarily as still as the very vaults of
Stanstead Church, nearly startled her out of her
senses.  The next instant, however, her own merry
laugh at her own terrors broke the echoes, for
what was the disturbance but the scratching of
the rats, whom her tour of discovery had sent
stampeding willy nilly, like bad Bishop Hatto's
long-tailed visitors:
</p>

<p>
  "From the right and the left, from behind and before,<br>
  From within and without, from above and below."<br>
</p>

<p>
Up by the chimney, down by the open windows
plump into the moat.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Ruth's secret.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Now," smiled Ruth to herself, in the dead
silence that ensued, "now I have a secret! and
never a creature shall be told of it.  Not even
Maudlin, nor Lawrence&mdash;Lawrence indeed! certainly
not!  A rare fine place to hide in when
next Lettice Larkspur and Dorothy Dingle come
to spend the day.  Why, if they'd search till
midnight, they'd not find me.  I should be shut in
safe&mdash;," here a sneeze, caused by the cloud of dust
her movements had raised, interrupted her, "safe
as the 'mistleto bough' bride.  Almost, that is to
say," she went on, brushing away the cobwebs
festooning her skirts, as she stepped back over the
skirting-board, and kneeling down to replace the
panel, she discovered that by the merest touch of
her finger she could work it backwards and
forwards in its grooves.  Not so hard to open as
the old oak chest was, certainly; though in every
probability it had been so once upon a time,
before the dry-rot had shrivelled the wood in its
sockets, and the fragments of iron bolts, some
strewing the floor, some still hanging, had rusted
and given way.  A pasteboard sort of protection
now the place would have been, though it was no
doubt safe enough in those war times of the Roses,
when it was built.
</p>

<p>
And carefully indeed Ruth had kept her secret,
though there were times when it grew to be
rather a burden to her.  When, for instance, she
lay in her bed and thought what dismal straits
those poor people must have been driven to, before
they should have sought such a refuge.
</p>

<p>
The very existence of the place is, however,
forgotten now in this other mystery that haunts her
sleeping and waking.
</p>

<p>
She does not find it at all true, as she sits uncoiling
her hair, and absently brushing out its brown
waves, that sharing her load of care makes it
lighter, as people are so fond of telling you that
it does.  The weight, on the contrary, seems to
have grown heavier, especially within these last
hours; and oblivious of everything beyond her
troubled reflections, she is only recalled to a sense
of realities by Maudlin Sweetapple's voice querulously
clamouring for the lamp to be extinguished.
"Beshrew the thing!" piped she; "how many
more times am I to shut my eyes, and open 'em
again, to see all these ghosts about the place?"
</p>

<p>
"Ghosts?" queried Ruth, escaping to Maudlin's
door, and peeping gingerly in.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Shadows on the wall.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Ay, marry, ghosts; black-sheeted ghosts all
over the walls," said Maudlin, pointing to the
restless shadows cast by the quivering flame of
Ruth's lamp.  "Look at 'em bobbin' about, and
a draught to cut a body's head off!  Have you
got a pane open in there, child?"
</p>

<p>
Doubtless that explained the inconvenience;
for Ruth had opened the pane in order to catch
the faintest sound that might disturb the silence
of the night.
</p>

<p>
"Then shut it," went on Maudlin, as Ruth
owned to the fact, "shut it, if you don't want
your poor old nurse to catch her death o' rheumatics.
A mighty fine sort of a night to be havin'
casements open, this!  What's gone, I wonder, of
all yesterday's sunshine?  'Tis as cold as
Candlemas.  Well they may say:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Cast ne'er a clout<br>
  Till May be out.'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
If&mdash;hark! what's that, child?"
</p>

<p>
"I heard nothing," answered Ruth, listening
with all her ears, "nothing but the rain," she
added, as a smart sleety shower rattled against
the glass.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The creak of the drawbridge.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"So 'tis&mdash;at last.  There wasn't a joint of all
my poor old bones that didn't tell me that was
comin'.  But 'twasn't that I heard.  'Twas&mdash;hush!
There 'tis again!  The clank o' the draw-bridge
chains! or I'll eat my head off."
</p>

<p>
"Don't make rash vows, you silly old dear!"
rejoined Ruth, with an uneasy little laugh.  "Wasn't
the drawbridge let up at sunset, as it always is?
What fancies you do take into your head, Maudlin!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, ay; 'tis as full of 'em, I daresay, as an
egg's full o' meat," grumbled on the old lady.  "'Tis
only the young ones that are the wise ones
nowadays.  Good lack! good lack! and how they do
like too sittin' up disturbin' the rest o' them that's
no mind for moonin' and star-gazin'."
</p>

<p>
"There's neither moon nor star to be seen,"
said Ruth, glancing towards the outside obscurity.
"'Tis a pitch-dark night."
</p>

<p>
"And ten, as I live, by the tower clock!  For
shame on thee, Ruth," continued the old woman,
as the strokes fell; "put out thy light this instant,
and grope to bed as thou canst; or I'll warrant
we shall never be hearin' the last o't from the
master to-morrow.  His one eye's sharper than a
dozen folk's two, and if it did catch sight of a
gleam&mdash;What do you say?"
</p>

<p>
"I did not speak."
</p>

<p>
"I fancied I heard you mumblin' somethin'.
For the merciful powers' sake put out the light,
I say."
</p>

<p>
"Good-night, Maudlin," said Ruth, obeying
the injunction at last, but not without reluctance.
</p>

<p>
A smothered sound, which might have been a
reciprocal good-night, but still more resembled a
snore, witnessed that the darkness had speedily
worked its slumberous effects on Maudlin.  Poor
Ruth, however, deprived of her lamp's companionship,
and too wakeful for bed, groped her way
back to her old seat, and sat, every nerve
sharpened, to catch the faintest echo.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A wild night.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Save the driving rain, however, and the sweeping
of the wind in low sullen gusts round the
walls, and its jerking of the tall vane on the
tower-top, till the thing complained direfully, not
a sound was to be heard.  A likely night, truly,
for folks to choose to be abroad, especially
thereabouts, where there was scarce so much as a tree
to shelter you.  Anyhow it was plain these
expected visitors of her father's had not been so
eager to be getting themselves dripping to the
skin; and the maltster had no doubt given them
up ever so long ago, and gone to bed.
</p>

<p>
Sidenote: The striking of the hour.]
</p>

<p>
With cramped limbs, but a lightened heart,
Ruth rose and once more approached to close the
pane, which she had again unfastened, after first
noiselessly closing Maudlin's door.  Well, bed was
after all no such uncomfortable place, she thought,
as the dank air blew in on her face, "when the
clock must be close on&mdash;hark! yes: ding-dang!
ding-dang! ding-dang!  Absolutely but wanting
one hour&mdash;ding-dang&mdash;to midnight!  Such an
unearthly ding&mdash;terrible&mdash;dang."&mdash;

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br><br>
IN THE WARDER'S ROOM.
</h3>

<p>
Ding!  Like some guilt-stricken creature
Ruth stood with her hands upon the
half-closed pane.
</p>

<p>
Lingeringly and drearily the sound
died in a low angry growl of wind, that came
sweeping up muffled and sullen as some vexed
human voice.  Hark!  hark!  surely that is a
human voice!&mdash;voices!  And that?  No steady
drip-drip of the rain from the mullions of the
casement, but footsteps stealthily passing along
the arched way below, and beginning to ascend
the stair winding to the Warder's Room!
</p>

<p>
Impossible!  Sure she must be growing more
fanciful than old Maudlin's self?  No, no; 'tis
but the tiresome rats again, holding their witches'
sabbath?  What else can it be?
</p>

<p>
The sudden flash of a torch full across her
window illumines the pitchy blackness below; and
then, as if hurled by some violent and angry hand,
the torch falls into the water and is extinguished.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Ruth on the watch.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Not quickly enough, however, to conceal from
Ruth the gigantic outlines of the drawbridge,
gliding higher and closer, till it is lost in the
shadow of the wall, and at the same time the
clank of its chains, more felt than heard, with
their dull familiar vibrating, ceases.
</p>

<p>
Who can have been tampering with them?
Surely not Adam Lockit.  Rather than be unfaithful
to his trust, and let down his bridge after
sunset, he would dispute every ounce of it with
his life's blood.  But what about Barnaby?
Barnaby! and even at that moment Ruth cannot
forbear a smile at the bare notion of Master Diggles'
Dutch courage displaying its mettle within six
hours of either side of midnight.  Even supposing
he could have performed the miracle of stealing a
march on Lockit, and getting possession of the
gatehouse keys.
</p>

<p>
No.  One alone, beside Adam Lockit, has the
means of working those chains&mdash;the master of
the Rye House himself.
</p>

<p>
Spell-bound and breathless, Ruth stands
listening to the stealthy but heavy tramp tramp of
those feet mounting the stone stair which leads
from the arched door in the wall of the gateway
to the Warder's Room.
</p>

<p>
Soon the sounds cease; to be quickly broken
again by hurried whispers and the low hum of
voices.  Muffled and indistinctly as they reach
her ear, the tones seem familiar to Ruth, and her
heart stands still.  What&mdash;what if Lawrence&mdash;?
</p>

<p>
Hardly has his name escaped her pale parted
lips before with swift noiseless tread she has
stolen to the wall, and falling on her knees before
the sliding panel, slips it back, and stepping into
the darkness beyond, crouches down.
</p>

<p>
Not an instant too soon, if movements so
cautious and catlike as hers could have betrayed
her; and that was possible, judging by the
distinctness with which she on her part can catch
every syllable that is being uttered in the Warder's
Room by the party of men gathering, as she can
plainly see through a long crack in the wood,
about the long table.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A cold welcome.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"All right, Master Hannibal," says a voice she
does not know.  "We wait your pleasure."
</p>

<p>
"Nay," objected another, which Ruth at once
recognized for one of those she had heard upon
the bridge, "your commands, Master Rumbold."
</p>

<p>
"By my faith! there you speak by the book,
colonel, like the good soldier you are," shiveringly
said a voice, whose delicate tones were also not
strange to Ruth.  "Pleasure's a fish that I for one
should be for angling after in other preserves than
the slush and bog of the Rye.  Hu! hu!" shuddered
the speaker.  "And not so much as a stick
of a blaze on your sepulchre of a hearth here,
Master Hannibal!  A merry welcome truly to bid
your boys! and all of us as wringing wet as any
of the rat vermin in your styx of a moat below
there.  I'm drenched to my skin."
</p>

<p>
"Had I imagined it to be so thin," dryly
returned the deep tones of the maltster, "I would
never have invited your lordship to join our company."
</p>

<p>
"And the place smells as mouldy as a vault,"
fretfully continued the nobleman.  "I can tell you,
had I known it was such a stretch from my house
I'd in any case have spared you my company to-night."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A wrangle.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"We could have dispensed with such fine-weather
friends," began a gruff surly voice, "if&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hold thy peace," interrupted Rumbold, "and
save your wit, Master West, till my Lord of
Escrick here can find his own to measure with it."
</p>

<p>
"Of a truth, I confess my brains seem all washed
out," said Howard more good-temperedly, "by
that last slush hole I floundered into, when I set
off in pursuit of the jack-o'-lanthorn, some idiot
among you said was a light in the Rye House."
</p>

<p>
"My Lord of Escrick makes a rare pother about
a sprinkle of rain," said the voice which was
strange to Ruth; "if he'd been jolted all the way
from Fleet Street, as I have been, atop of the raw
bones of a pack-horse like a sack of husks&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush! by your leave, Master West," for the
remembrance of his sufferings warmed the speaker's
eloquence.  "Not so loud.  Some one sleeps in the
adjoining chamber."
</p>

<p>
"Marry! 'twould have been as well then,"
rejoined West, in sour, but considerably lowered
tones, "if you had thought fit to entertain us in
some other part of your ramshackle house here,
less conveniently adapted for eavesdropping&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And for getting off if we should be surprised,"
said Rumbold quietly.  "Have I not explained
often enough, that this chamber is in direct
communication with the subterranean way to Nether
Hall?  You shall judge it for yourself presently,
as I promised you."
</p>

<p>
"And besides," put in Walcot, "we are safe,
Master Rumbold said, from being overlooked on
this side."
</p>

<p>
"The place seems Scylla or Charybdis," said
Howard laughing, "and a veritable vermin trap to
boot&mdash;if one may judge by the snuffling in there,"
and he pointed to the wainscot, "eh, Master
Hannibal?"
</p>

<p>
"The four-legged pests do somewhat overabound
here, my lord," answered Rumbold; "but my own
friends are safe enough, I pledge you my word.
I did but entreat Master West to be a bit careful.
His voice is scarce so still and small as caution
behoves."
</p>

<p>
"Liken it rather unto that of a trumpet," piped
the shrill tones of Ferguson, "which shall blare to
the uttermost walls&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Walls have ears.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"All in its good time, Master Ferguson," interrupted
Walcot; "meanwhile remember walls have
ears."
</p>

<p>
"And so have listeners," growled West, still
sorely put about with himself for his own
forgetfulness, "long as asses' ones."
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said Rumbold, "they'd have to be
longer and sharper too, to pierce these walls.
More than three feet and a half thick I know
them to be."
</p>

<p>
"And all of pure stone?" inquired a voice.
</p>

<p>
"No, of oak, Master Sheriff, which is at least
as trustworthy."
</p>

<p>
"It is a strange omen," said Walcot ruminatively,
</p>

<p>
"A what?" derisively chorused half a dozen
voices.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis not the first time oak has served Charles
a good turn in his evil hour."
</p>

<p>
"What's the man maundering about?" said West.
</p>

<p>
"I know not," growled Rumsey.  "Unless it be
of that accursed Boscobel oak-tree.  Well, well,
I'll warrant root and branch shall be lopped this
time close enough, eh, Master Rumbold? and we'll
bring its fine acorns into the mud.  Come, to
business.  Are we all here?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not see my friend of the other night,"
said Howard looking round.  "The young gentleman
who so deftly rendered my hand that
surgeon's service."
</p>

<p>
"Lawrence Lee, you mean, my lord?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, that was his name.  A likely young fellow
he seemed.  A neighbour of yours, I think you
said, Master Hannibal?"
</p>

<p>
"He should have been here," said the maltster;
"but 'tis no matter, we can do without him.
He is&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Noisy rats.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"To be trusted, let us hope," growled West.
"I swear, Master Rumbold," and he glowered
towards the wainscot, "your rats are the noisiest
I ever heard."
</p>

<p>
Poor Ruth shivered with terror.  She had but
stirred to avert the worse crash of a slip she had
nearly made in that cramped space.
</p>

<p>
"The vane atop of this roof, creaking in the
wind," said Rumbold carelessly.
</p>

<p>
"If we should find these Rye House rats of the
spy genus, we'll spit them on it," said West.
</p>

<p>
"And you along with them, Master Rumbold,"
said a voice which had not yet spoken.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A chest of tools.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Your insinuations waste precious time, Sir
Thomas Armstrong," said Rumbold, a frown of
offended dignity puckering his brows as he turned
and, crossing to the great oaken chest standing
between the windows, raised its ponderous lid with
both hands.  "I would not be held a boaster; but
those who have known Richard Rumbold longer
than you have, will tell you that he is not the man
to put his hand to the plough and draw it back.
See," he went on, addressing the rest, who greeted
his last words with a low murmur of applause,
"here lie our tools," and he pointed into the open
chest, "all in order; not forgetting the last
cargo&mdash;muskets, bayonets, blunderbusses, and all."

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br><br>
THE PLOT THICKENS.
</h3>

<p>
"Blunderbusses!" shrieked a voice,
which seemed to retreat, as it spoke,
into the room's remotest corners; "the
gracious powers above!  Mind, for
mercy's sake, be careful.  Not loaded?" piteously
went on the speaker.  "Say they're not loaded,
Master Rumbold."
</p>

<p>
"Not yet, Master Sheriff," grimly smiled Rumbold.
</p>

<p>
"But whatever can we be wanting of such
fearful things?" insisted Goodenough.
</p>

<p>
"That remains to be seen," laughed West,
approaching the chest; and selecting a weapon from
its gleaming contents, he placed it in Rumbold's
hands.  "Here, Master Hannibal, is the one I
promised you for your special use.  A jewel of a
thing.  Be careful of it."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, yes, yes, do," entreated Goodenough; "hear
what Master West says about it himself."
</p>

<p>
"A sacred trust indeed," murmured Rumbold,
thoughtfully handling the weapon, "and wielding
a mighty power, for good or for ill.  Come, Parson
Ferguson," he went on, suddenly changing his
mood, and turning to the tall, lean, sable-clad
individual standing on his right "What say
you?  Will you consecrate it?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Foul play.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Of a surety it has my blessing," answered
Ferguson, displaying his ugly yellow fangs of
teeth in a broad grin.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, to business then," continued the
maltster, carefully restoring the blunderbuss to its
place and closing the chest.  "Come, have we our
parts by heart?  You, and you," he went on,
singling out three of the company, "and you."
</p>

<p>
"Oy, oy! sartain sure enough we be o' ourn,"
said the foremost of the trio, slouching to the front,
and elbowing his two comrades forward along
with him, so that Ruth could plainly discern their
features, and recognized them for the foreman of
the malting-yard, one of his subordinates, and a
man who worked in the corn-chambers.  "Roight
enough we be, an't us?" he went on, appealing to
the sheepish, hangdog looking couple beside him.
"'Tes for we to be trampin' out Stanstead way,
an' hidin' us among the hedges and ditches till us
catches soight o' the king's coach an six; an' then
'tes for we to be turnin' tail in a twinklin', and
run as quick&mdash;as quick as&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Twice as quick anyhow, friend, as the twenty-four
legs of his majesty's Flanders mares," said
Howard with a slight yawn.
</p>

<p>
"Back agin to the Rye House here," continued
the spokesman, "an' be tellin' the rest o' yer which
coach the king's a-ridin' in&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And how many&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'm a comin' to that, an't I? an' how many's
a follerin' after 'em in coaches too, an' how many
guards a 'orseback&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Six at the outside," said Rumbold.  "'Tis never
more.  You, colonel," he went on, addressing
Walcot, "undertake to attack them."
</p>

<p>
"As a soldier, I claim that privilege," answered
Walcot.
</p>

<p>
"If report speaks truth, you're not wanting in
bravery," said Rumsey, measuring the stately and
graceful figure of Walcot with rather jealous eyes;
"but six is a biggish handful for one man to
tackle; and if," he went on with a sneer, "your
gift of second sight should chance to be making
twelve of it&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Or if in fact there should happen to be so
many," quietly interrupted Walcot, "I trust I may
not be found wanting&mdash;nor tripping neither."
</p>

<p>
"As to the beasts," said Rumbold quickly, "we
shall have little trouble with them.  They'll all
be spent and weak as water with the long stage."
</p>

<p>
"They change at Hoddesdon, do they not?"
said Howard.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Preparations for treason.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"If they were foreordained to reach there, they
would, my lord," rebukefully replied Rumbold.
"And now, what about the disguises?" he
continued, addressing his foreman.
</p>

<p>
The son of the soil scratched his carroty poll,
and gazed round with lack-lustre eyes.  "The
what, maaster?" he said at last.
</p>

<p>
"The labourers' clothes, man, that you promised
to furnish my Lord Howard here with, and the
other gentlemen."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The disguises.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Oy, oy," and a gleam of intelligence broke
over the stolid face.  "Now you speak English,
Maaster Rumbold.  Yes, they be all roight enough;
leastways they will be.  But 'tes jest a bit of a
job loike, doant'e see, Master Rumbold.  Stands
to reason as 'tes, doant it?  Gettin' tagether o'
poor folks' togs.  The quality's got any quantity
o' coats an' britches, silk and satin', an' velvet
an' double broadcloth into the bargain; but 'taint
every day an' ollis, as yer poor man's gotten his
one decent smock.  But, never ya fret, my lord.
Me an' these here," and he jerked his thumb at
his two comrades, "a doin' our main best; an' the
blame woan't be to our door, if us doant make
such clod poles and scares o' ya, an' these here
other dandy gen'lemen, as the very crows sha'ant
be able to make up their minds whether to fly
away from ya for freight, or peck yer eyes out
as ya walk along."
</p>

<p>
"That is satisfactory," said Rumbold.  "The
next question," he went on, letting his gaze rest
on the elegant proportions of Howard, who had
thrown himself in a careless lounging attitude
into a tall-backed Cordovan leather chair, "the
next question is"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"So it be," interrupted the foreman of the malt-yard;
"so it be, maaster, an' 'twas no more than
us was a sayin' of as we coomed along here.
Warn't us?" and again he appealed to his mates,
who nodded stolidly.  "'Tes sartin as our cat's got
a tail, there's not one o' the lot o' ya as looks to
be trusted loike."
</p>

<p>
"Fellow!" fiercely demanded Howard, springing
to his feet, "what do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
How to stop the King's coach.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"The wagon is a main heavy one," continued the
man, unheeding the angry frowns of Howard and
the rest, "and'll need a power of elbergrease
afore't can be turned over; an' we can't be lendin'
you fine gen'lemen that, along with our britches
an' smocks.  You'd best have the cart overturned
by we first," and he pointed to his companions,
"afore we start away, doant ya know?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not," said Howard haughtily; "I
hope we're not such idiots that we can't do carter's
work."
</p>

<p>
"Carter's work!  Why! 'tes carter's work to be
keepin' of his wheels from gettin' bottom
uppermost.  Noa, noa, ye'll never be but gimcrack
soarts o' carters, take ya at ya best, an' if ye're
for doing of the upset yerselves, there should be
six o' ye to the work, my lord, or ye'll make a
mess o't, be shure."
</p>

<p>
"Then," said Howard, "it remains for you to
supply us with the six needful pairs of breeches,
and hobnailed shoes."
</p>

<p>
"I'll swear for the britches, an' the shoes ye'll
have to make stretch as far as they'll go."
</p>

<p>
"And you," said Rumbold, turning to West and
a group near.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, we engage for the coachman, the postilion,
and the horses," nodded West.  "We're quite content,
Master Hannibal, to leave you to bring down
the Blackbird and the Chaffinch.  You're a fine
shot, and ought to do it at one priming, with
such tools as you've got for it; tho' 'tis true you'll
be two to one, and your birds have got some blood
in them."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, but their claws will be blunt," laughed
Rumsey.  "'Tis scarce probable, I mean, that they'll
carry so much as a sword between them.  They
never do."
</p>

<p>
"Still assistance should be at hand, and close
too," said Sir Thomas Armstrong.

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Lawrence Lee in the toils.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Among the whole twoscore names written
here," said Rumbold, drawing a large roll of parchment
from his pocket, and unrolling it, he glanced
over its contents, "there is not a steadier hand,
nor a stouter heart, than my young neighbour's here
of Nether Hall, Lawrence Lee."
</p>

<p>
"Lawrence Lee!" echoed Walcot, casting an
involuntary glance behind him ere the words had
well left his lips.  Could he be such a prey to
strange fancies, or had he in very deed and truth
heard a low gasping breath break from the wall?
"You're certain he's to be trusted?"
</p>

<p>
"I flatter myself," replied the maltster, a faint
smile curling his lips, "that Master Lawrence Lee
would think twice before he refused to comply
with the slightest wish of Richard Rumbold."
</p>

<p>
"Wasn't his father a Royalist?" said Howard.
</p>

<p>
"And what if he were, my lord?" rejoined
Rumbold.  "Lee is a lad of spirit, and exercises
his right of private judgment."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly," said Howard, with a dubious shrug.
"He takes leave to call his soul his own.  And
that, of course, is all in this business.  But how
about his heart?  You have a daughter, have you
not, Master Hannibal?"
</p>

<p>
"And what if I have, my lord?" said the
maltster coldly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no offence," carelessly returned Howard;
"but she is a comely lass, they say.  Quite a
rustic beauty."
</p>

<p>
"Beauty is skindeep, my lord.  She is a good
child."
</p>

<p>
"And minds her doll," broke out Rumsey in a
hoarse laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said Rumbold in displeased tones, "my
Ruth's doll-days are about over.  But she minds
her wheel; and meddles not in such matters as
we are discussing&mdash;or should be discussing," he
added, as the clock over their heads struck
midnight.  "Moments are precious."
</p>

<p>
"And for my part," said Howard, this time with
an unmistakable yawn, "I think we are misusing
them odiously.  There is a fortnight still before
the king comes back from Newmarket; and between
this and then all sorts of things may occur to
change his plans."
</p>

<p>
"What is to be, will be," said Rumbold solemnly.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A deep snore.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh! that I grant you," said Lord Howard
with a portentous yawn, glancing at the same
time towards one of the window embrasures,
whence issued a prolonged deep sound, not unlike
the smothered growl of a wild beast, but which
in fact emanated from the nose of Sheriff
Goodenough, who lay back, lost in the enjoyment of
a snatched forty winks.  "That I grant you,
and so seemingly does our good sheriff here; for
he has yielded to the inevitable, and is snoring
like a trooper.  Shake him up, colonel," he added
to Walcot, who stood close by, leaning against the
panes, and gazing thoughtfully out into the night.
"If you're not asleep yourself, that is."
</p>

<p>
"Very far from it, my lord," answered Walcot,
rousing up and approaching the table; "I was
thinking that all being said and done, it is time
to consider the measures for our safety.  We
don't want to be run down inside these four walls
like a pack of weasels."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The subterranean way.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"By no means," said West; "we're going to
burrow underground before we part to-night, for
a good mile and a half through Master Hannibal's
subterranean way.  Aren't we captain?  So as
to make sure we don't blunder our heads into any
wrong holes, when the time comes."
</p>

<p>
"An excellent notion," said Howard with animation.
"And a better night than this abominable
Noah's deluge of a one could not be.  'Twill spare
us wading like a flock of geese to&mdash;.  By the way,
where did you say it brings us out, captain?"
</p>

<p>
"Into a large vault that lies under the right-hand
tower of the ruined gatehouse of Nether
Hall."
</p>

<p>
"And near the river?"
</p>

<p>
"Within a hundred yards of it."
</p>

<p>
"And then 'Sauve qui peut,' I suppose."
</p>

<p>
Rumbold inclined his head gravely.
</p>

<p>
"And Nether Hall," continued Howard, "belongs
to our young friend Farmer Lee.  I perceive now.
You're a clever man, Captain Hannibal.  You
did well indeed to win the fellow to our cause,
since his premises appear to be indispensable to
our precious lives.  But how is it we do not see
him here to bid us welcome to his dungeons?"
</p>

<p>
"We may find him below.  But if not, 'tis no
matter; and if he should have stolen a leaf from
Master Goodenough's book there, and gone to bed,
I have the duplicate keys.  He has made them
over to me;" and the maltster, kindling his
extinguished torch, signed to his companions to
do the same.  "'Tis pretty well pitch dark," he
added warningly, "even in broad daylight, every
step of the way.  Ho there, Sheriff!  Wake up!
And a murrain on you for a sleepy-head.  Give
him a pinch, colonel," he added to Rumsey, who
chanced to be seated nearest the sleeper.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Two left behind.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't be so barbarous," replied Rumsey,
with a peculiar sneering smile.  "Hark!" he went
on, as a thunderous snort was all the comment on
Rumbold's adjuration.  "Let him be."
</p>

<p>
"Oy, oy.  Let 'm bide, cap'n," said the foreman.
"They narrer cellars an't for the loikes of a
hogshead like he.  He'd be stickin' fast in the middle
o' them like a dodnum in a duck's weasand.  Let
'un sleep his sleep out."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, man!" said Walcot.  "We can't leave
him here all alone."
</p>

<p>
"He won't be alone if I'm with him, I suppose,"
said Rumsey with a snarl; "and I shall remain
here.  You won't catch me coming down to break
my shins in your pitch-dark vaults at this time
of night; as if I wasn't lamed enough already
with that confounded stumble I made on Monday
night.  Time enough when I've got to run for it."
</p>

<p>
"Do as you please," said Rumbold; "I shall be
back in a couple of hours or so."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay.  Don't hurry.  'Twill be right enough
if you leave us here."
</p>

<p>
"Like doves in a cage.  Ha! ha!  Or a couple
of fighting cocks," said Howard, with a laugh that
was echoed a little dubiously by all present, for it
was no secret among them that Rumsey and
Goodenough did not love each other.  "Well,
well; slumber, my darling! eh colonel? ha, ha,
ha! and peace be with you."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The conspirators' stair.
</span>
</p>

<p>
And Howard, lighting his torch as he spoke,
followed the rest, who, preceded by Rumbold,
were beginning to file down the winding stair
through the door by which they had entered.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br><br>
A LITTLE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.
</h3>

<p>
When the shuffling of the footsteps of the
conspirators had died away far down
below, not a sound was to be heard, save
the rain, now fallen to a gentle patter,
and ever and anon the wind spending itself in low
fitful moans round the old mansion.  From time
to time, however, this monotony was varied by
the obbligato which Sheriff Goodenough's nose
continued to trumpet forth.
</p>

<p>
One more than ordinarily prolonged and loud
snort afforded Ruth an opportunity of changing
her cramped position, and at the same time of
obtaining a clearer view of the scene before her.
</p>

<p>
Almost immediately facing her, at the corner
of the table, sat Rumsey, staring with such a fixed
steady gaze straight before him, through the
lamp's thin flickering flame, that she trembled
and sank crouching to the floor.  Could he have
caught sight of her?
</p>

<p>
Never a fear of that.  For even if he had
chanced to notice the long straggling crack in the
wainscot, and that tiny hole caused by the
displacement of a little knot in the wood, you had
but to look at his moody face a second time, to
be sure that his thoughts were blinding his
outward senses to all around him; save when from
time to time he turned his head on his sleeping
companion with an ugly look of mingled mistrust
and contempt.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Rumsey draws cold steel.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Clod! idiot!" he growled at last through his
clenched teeth, at the same time drawing a short
poignard from a sheath in his buff leathern belt,
and throwing it on the table with such a clatter
that it woke the sheriff, who sat up with a start of
terror.
</p>

<p>
"Ha; thieves!" he shouted.  "Murder!  Call
the watch!"
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, sheriff; what's the matter?"
laughed Rumsey.  "Are you dreaming still? don't
you know where you are?  Hey! look about you,
man."
</p>

<p>
Goodenough obeyed mechanically; and his
dazed eyes, as fate would have it, fell first upon
the naked dagger, glittering in the lamplight&mdash;"What's
that? what's that?" he shrieked again,
startled into all his senses at the sight of the
thing.  "Take it away!  For mercy's sake, take
it away," he entreated piteously.  "It&mdash;it's just
what I've been dreaming about!  Put it up,
Master Rumsey; dear Master Rumsey, put it
away in its proper place."
</p>

<p>
"When I am quite sure where that is, I will,"
coolly answered Rumsey.  "In the meantime
you and I, sheriff, will just have a little bit of
gossip together.  There couldn't be a nicer
opportunity for it, while we've got the place all snug
to ourselves; 'under four eyes,' as they used to
call it when I served in Italy."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The sheriff and his enemy,
</span>
</p>

<p>
"But where are they all?" said Goodenough,
staring round into the darkness visible, with eyes
now thoroughly wide-awake.  "And how the
plague came I to fall asleep?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose only Sheriff Goodenough can solve
that problem," answered Rumsey with a shrug.
</p>

<p>
"But where are they all?" persisted Goodenough.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" impatiently said Rumsey, "down below."
</p>

<p>
"Down below!" gasped Goodenough.  "Oughtn't
we to be there along with them, colonel?  They'd
no business to go leaving us all alone;" and the
sheriff shivered&mdash;"Eh, ought they now?  Let's
be going too, shall we?" and Goodenough rose
to his feet, and began stumbling in his haste to
reach the door, over the disorder of chairs and
footstools.  "I'd rather, I would indeed."
</p>

<p>
"Too late," said Rumsey.  "They're ever so
far by now.  Serves you right, sheriff.  Who
ever heard of being caught napping when there's
work of this sort on hand?  Come, now&mdash;steady
there&mdash;come.  It's of no earthly use your rattling
the bolts about like that.  The captain's locked
us in."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, he hasn't," said Goodenough frantically,
wrenching at the ponderous door till he
dragged it half open.  "See!"
</p>

<p>
"The mischief seize you!" savagely returned
Rumsey, snatching off Goodenough's hands, and
banging to the door again with a kick "Not
that one.  The door, I mean, down at the stairfoot.
'Tis locked, I tell you.  Double, triple locked; and
you can't get out if you tore your arms off trying."
</p>

<p>
"But never mind," he went on, as Goodenough
fell back despairingly against the wall,
"don't look so down in the mouth, man; ain't
I here?" and with a low chuckle of amusement
at the poor man's discomfiture, he flung
himself into a chair, and thrusting his hands
deep into his pockets, sat watching through
his half-closed eyelids every movement of his
companion, who retreated slowly to a chair
standing farthermost from Rumsey, and sat down
on its edge, looking the very picture of wretchedness
and despondency.  "'Tis too bad," he said
shiveringly, "I wish I hadn't come.  I wish
I'd never&mdash;"  Then he stopped short.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" sharply interrogated Rumsey, fixing
the unfortunate man's wandering glances with
the steady, piercing, snakelike glitter of his own.
"Say on, sheriff, out with it; you wish you'd
never&mdash;joined this conspir&mdash;this society; is that it?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A faltering tongue.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"I said nothing of the sort, Master Rumsey,"
faltered Goodenough.  "But I&mdash;I&mdash;I do say&mdash;h'm.
No matter;" and as his eyes followed
Rumsey's, which were fixed on the dagger upon
the table, he relapsed into silence.
</p>

<p>
"On the contrary," said Rumsey in calm hard
tones, "'tis very great matter.  Our noble
association brooks no sticklers, nor cowards neither.
What were you going to say?"
</p>

<p>
"That I hope there's not going to be any&mdash;any
blood-spilling," said Goodenough in a steadier
voice.
</p>

<p>
"Whose blood?" laughed Rumsey.  "Charles's,
do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, heaven forbid!" fervently ejaculated
Goodenough, "and forgive us the bare thought.
Of the guards, I meant, or of any with him."
</p>

<p>
"That they must take their risk of, pretty
dears," sneered Rumsey, "so long only as we
secure our Blackbird, and our Chaffinch."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Murderous plans.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay," sighed Goodenough.  "Well, 'tmust
be chanced, I suppose, as you say, colonel; and
perhaps if it comes to't, the sacrifice of a man's
life will be forgiven by Providence, so only as we
can succeed in bringing his majesty to our way
of thinking, and make our Protestant religion
safe from these popish scoundrels; and bind him
to appoint a real true Church of England king
to come after him."
</p>

<p>
"Instead of the Chaffinch."
</p>

<p>
"The Duke of York must certainly be set
aside, if it be true indeed that he is a Papist
at heart."
</p>

<p>
"If!" cried Rumsey in tones that might have
been crook-backed Richard's own.
</p>

<p>
"But I never dreamed," continued Goodenough,
"that 'twould come to blood-spilling, I protest,
even of so much as a poor horse's."
</p>

<p>
"Bluer blood than a wretched Flanders mare's,
or a handful of red coats', will be staining yonder
road before this moon's out, I take it," muttered
Rumsey.  "You're a fool, Master Goodenough," he
added in a louder key, and turning contemptuously
on Goodenough; "a cowardly fool."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Goodenough, and he rose to his feet,
a sudden light of indignation in his eyes; "but
you are a traitor, Richard Rumsey! and 'tis not
now for the first time I read your murderous
thoughts."  A low laugh was all Rumsey's
comment.  "Master Rumbold," hurried on Goodenough,
"and Colonel Walcot&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Bah!  Walcot!" interrupted Rumsey, snapping
his fingers.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A dangerous threat.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"And my Lord of Escrick and the rest know
well enough how I have bidden them beware of you."
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely!" said Rumsey, elevating his brows,
and the corners of his mouth quivering about his
teeth like some hungry hyena's.  "We're as mighty
fine as the pot was, when it talked a homily to
the kettle.  Do you imagine that Charles, once safe
in their clutches, our good captain, or my Lord of
Escrick, or any man-jack of our forty boys, would
let him off alive?"
</p>

<p>
Goodenough was silent for a moment.  "I
doubt they would not one of them stain their
hands with cold blood," he said then.  "And for
a certainty I can speak to Walcot&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Psha! speak no more of him, the white-livered loon."
</p>

<p>
"I can speak to Walcot," stoutly persisted
Goodenough, "for many times I have heard him
say that a fair front-to-front tussle with the
guards was what his soul itched for.  But for
attacking the king he would not do it; for that it
was a base thing to kill a naked man."
</p>

<p>
"Naked!" sneeringly echoed Rumsey as he rose
from his chair and sauntered towards the table,
on whose edge he seated himself, and began
carelessly toying with the handle of the poignard
he had thrown there.  "Let his purple and fine
linen shield him."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The coward speaks up.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"They would stand him in less stead against a
bullet or a blade-thrust, than even my good
Norwich drugget here would shield me, if any man
bore me a grudge," answered Goodenough with
a faint smile.  "But 'tis no matter; why should
it be spoken of?  'Tis quite certain that none of
us are for killing the king, nor anybody else."
</p>

<p>
Rumsey's lips twitched with the old baleful
smile.  "There I think you are out, Master Sheriff,"
he said, as he took the poignard into his hand, and
began examining its hilt with a half absent
attention.  "The puling scruples of a mere handful
out of all our forty boys would not go for much;"
and he fixed his eyes in a covert glare on
Goodenough, who stood thoughtfully gazing into the
lamp; "and these must be got rid of, for a 'house
divided against itself cannot stand.'"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis the assassins who must be got rid of,"
sturdily retorted Goodenough.  "For they foully
blot our cause."
</p>

<p>
"Ha!" cried Rumsey starting up, with the
poignard clutched fast in his hand.  "Do you
forget who&mdash;what I am?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
An assassin.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Nay.  But I think you do," answered Goodenough
calmly.  "You should be a soldier, but it
looks much as if you would have me take you for
a scoundrel, and a craven-hearted assassin!"
</p>

<p>
The last word was lost in a sudden sharp
shriek of agony; and swaying round, Goodenough
clutched convulsively at the poignard
which lay plunged to the hilt in his breast, and
fell heavily to the floor.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br><br>
"DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES."
</h3>

<p>
"So, Master Sheriff," muttered Rumsey,
as he stood coolly watching the thin
stream of blood trickling slowly from
the prostrate body of his victim,
"that is one of you ticked off, at all events.  It
was such a pity you should be calling names for
nothing, wasn't it? and wasps like you are mightily
troublesome, not to say dangerous; for who's to
guess where you mightn't go buzzing our plans?
Not dead yet, aren't you?" he went on scowlingly,
as a low groan broke from Goodenough's lips.
"Why, you yelled out loud enough for a dozen
men.  I swear I could almost have fancied 'twas a
woman's screech, 'twas so shrill;" and he looked
round as he spoke.  "But then one might fancy
anything in this charnel hole of a place;" and
again he cast covert glances at the shadows thrown
upon the wainscotting by the flicker of the expiring
lamp; and crossing to one of the windows, he
looked out through the murky darkness, towards
a light gleaming steadily in the far distance.
"Cold as charity it is too.  I'd give a gold piece
to be out of this, and drying before the kitchen
fire over at the Thatched House at Hoddesdon
yonder, with a cup of mulled sack and a tender
cut.&mdash;The mischief seize you!" he growled on, as
a deep groan from the wounded man arrested his
speculations, and turning sharply on him he saw
Goodenough feebly move his right hand towards
his breast.  "Not still yet?  Hang it!  Richard
Rumsey never pinned a jerkin so clumsily before.
Want it pulled out, do you?" he continued, with a
brutal laugh, as he came close up beside his
victim, and stooping over him, plucked the poignard
from his breast.  "Have your way, then.  But
don't be saying it's my fault, if your last gasp
comes with it."  Then with savage indifference
he saw the ebbing thread of life-blood swell into
a stream let loose by the removal of the weapon,
and the limbs relax, while the face grows gray and
fixed.  "So, I thought as much.  Well, go your
ways friend, to your journey's end, and keep
yourself ready when you get there, to welcome the
Blackbird and the Chaffinch when they knock.
And now I think I'll be going my road;" and
Rumsey glanced meditatively towards the window.
"Another time will serve to explain to Captain
Hannibal how you got yourself into this coil.
Stay," and he slowly lifted the blood-stained
poignard still dangling in his fingers.  "A mighty
excellent notion!"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The assassin.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Kneeling down by the wounded man's side, he
wrenched open the clenched fingers of his right
hand, and thrust the hilt of the dagger between
them.  "Yes," he muttered; "that will tell its
own tale.  And now for the Thatched House."
</p>

<p>
Returning to the window, and craning out his
neck, Rumsey spent several minutes, first in
consideration of the projecting corbels and cornices,
and the stout web work of ivy covering the walls;
then drawing his head back again, he fell to
scowling contemplation of his lamed foot.  Once
on terra firma, nothing, he knew, was easier than
to find the postern; and if by ill luck it should
be locked, the trees bordering the walls on their
inner side would assist him to scale them, and so
away across the Rye by the bridges.
</p>

<p>
Only the first step was the hard one; but the
guilty man knew there was no choice for him but
to grapple with it; and after one or two clumsy
failures, he succeeded in at last obtaining a firm
footing on the window ledge.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
An unexpected appearance.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Scarcely had he accomplished this feat, than a
flash of light broke across his eyes, with such
startling suddenness that it caused him to sway
forward, and he would have dropped headlong
into the moat, had he not stretched out both
hands, clinging for dear life to the stout old ivy
trails; and by a wrench and a twist that for some
hours afterward he did not forget, held on by the
jutting stone-work of the window, staring
helplessly into the room at the figure of a man, who
stood lantern in hand, in the arch of the door
facing him.  "Hullo!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"The same to you, colonel," laughingly returned
the voice of Lawrence Lee.  "What in the
name of Fortune are you about there?  Marry!
'Tis an odd time of night to be practising gymnastics!"
</p>

<p>
"Lend me a hand for mercy's sake!" gasped
Rumsey, "or I shall fall and break my neck."
</p>

<p>
"And it would be such a pity that, eh, colonel?"
laughed Lee, as he ran forward.  "Have with
you then."
</p>

<p>
"Great heaven!" he cried, stumbling in his
haste head foremost across the body of
Goodenough; "what have we here?  Sheriff Goodenough!"
he continued in horrified amazement, as
he turned his lantern light on the pale still face,
and perceived the pool of blood it lay weltering
in.  "Dead?  Murdered?"
</p>

<p>
Rumsey shrugged his shoulders with an air of
cool indifference.
</p>

<p>
"Man!" shouted Lee, turning on Rumsey.
"What is the meaning of this?"
</p>

<p>
"Pooh! nonsense!" replied Rumsey, as well as
his almost spent breath permitted him.  "Dead!
Well, like enough; but murdered&mdash;Here, hi! lend
a hand, can't you?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Saved for the gallows.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Lawrence complied; but the hand he placed
at Rumsey's disposal was no very gentle one, and
he hauled him to the floor like a sack of bones.
"Speak, man!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"Well, give me breathing time," answered
Rumsey, shaking himself; and then, glancing
askance at the dark mass upon the floor, he growled
sulkily, "What is it?  What do you want to
know?  Murdered?  Well, killing's no murder, I
take it, when a man is driven to it in self-defence."
</p>

<p>
"Self-defence!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay.  There's no telling where I mightn't be
now, if this quarrelsome fellow here, had got the
best of me.  Don't you see the dagger there in
his hand?"
</p>

<p>
"Where are you hurt?" asked Lawrence, looking
from the dagger to Rumsey.
</p>

<p>
"I?&mdash;I?&mdash;Oh!" stammered Rumsey confusedly;
"well, well, 'tis nothing to speak of.  A scratch;
hardly a mere scratch."
</p>

<p>
"Who's dagger is this?" demanded Lee, stooping
down, and closely inspecting the weapon in
Goodenough's grasp.
</p>

<p>
"Whose should it be?" rejoined Rumsey, letting
his eyes fall shiftily beneath the penetrating glance
of Lee, as it fell on him.
</p>

<p>
"Faith! well, only I never knew him to carry so
much as a bare bodkin about him," said Lawrence.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The traitor's tale.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Then that shows how little you do know him,"
retorted Rumsey.  "A more bloodthirsty,
cantankerous fellow than he is, isn't to be found
among the lot of us.  Why, he's for lopping
everybody who doesn't say 'snap' to his 'snip.'"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis very strange," said Lee thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"A nice thing," grumbled on Rumsey, letting
his eyes rest on Lee's left hand, which hung
straight down beside him.  "A nice thing to
attack a man in this fashion, as if he was a
viper in a rut.  And it's preciously fortunate
I'm always prepared for any surprise.  You'd find
it a hard matter to catch Richard Rumsey on the
hip;" and he smiled a smile of infinite
self-complacency.  "What's that dangling in your fingers
there?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The key.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Only the key of the tower door," absently
replied Lee.  "But," he went on, again keenly glancing
over Rumsey's figure: "it takes two to a fair
fight&mdash;and a pair of weapons.  Where is yours?"
</p>

<p>
"Hadn't I my choice of twoscore at least out of
the toys there?" said Rumsey after an instant's
silence, and pointing to the oaken chest.  "If you
doubt it look for yourself.  A real embarrassment
of riches, eh?" he went on, watching Lee's face,
as he lifted the lid of the chest and stood gazing
at its gleaming contents.  "Enough to do for a
score of lives if one had 'em.  But the best of us
has but one in this bad world," he continued,
piously turning up his eyes; "and Providence has
spared me, as you see, from the sword of the
ungodly.  I'd have given my best firelock, though,
it had not happened;" and for once Rumsey
spoke pure and simple truth.  "The fellow had
his faults, but I had a great respect for him."
</p>

<p>
"And is that what sent you clearing off in such
a hurry?" asked Lawrence, turning contemptuously
from Rumsey, and kneeling down beside
Goodenough's motionless body he set his lantern
on the floor, and the key beside it, and raised the
wounded man's head; "and leaving him in this
state?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see&mdash;" but here a violent fit of
coughing interfered with Colonel Rumsey's powers
of articulation.  "Hang that open window!" he
said, when speech at last returned; "'tis enough to
give a man his death," he went on, as he closed the
pane with such violence that the draught from it
extinguished the dying flame of the lamp.  "It
was&mdash;h'm&mdash;h'm&mdash;it was awkward, don't you see, being
found here, with&mdash;with no one to tell the tale but
myself, as it were; for dead men tell none," he
added with a low chuckle.
</p>

<p>
"He's not dead," said Lawrence, placing his
hand on Goodenough's heart.
</p>

<p>
"Bah! dead as a door-nail.  I'm mightily
sorry for it, to be sure; but the fellow brought it
on himself.  What could I do?  Necessity knows
no law."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
In the dark.
</span>
</p>

<p>
And Rumsey, stooping down over Lee as if
to scrutinize the countenance lying pillowed on
the young man's arm, contrived to let his hand
drop well over the key upon the floor.  Then
clutching the ring of the lantern, he paused and
repeated his observation.  "Take my word for it.
He's dead as a door-nail.  Good-night, Master
Lee.  I'll leave you to explain matters, if it's all
the same to you."
</p>

<p>
Lee looked up.  Absorbed in his efforts to
staunch the flow of blood from Goodenough's
wound, he had hardly heard Rumsey's last words.
As, however, he raised his head the door fell softly
to, and he found himself in total darkness.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br><br>
"GOD SAVE THE KING!"
</h3>

<p>
"Come back!" he shouted.
</p>

<p>
He might more effectually have
summoned back the wind, as it swept
past with a low snarling hiss, as if in
mockery of his indignation; and before he had
time to repeat the words, the last echo of Rumsey's
footsteps had died on the lowermost stair, and
Lawrence Lee heard the scraping of the key in
the lock of the tower door.
</p>

<p>
"Coward!" he cried aloud, "will you have me
fetch you back?" and gently replacing the wounded
man upon the ground, he rose to his feet, and
with a couple of strides reached the door; but
scarcely had he done, so than a deep groan from
Goodenough brought him to a halt, and he turned,
dizzy with perplexity.  "To allow this fellow to
get clear off was not to be thought of; and yet,
to give chase to him and leave the unfortunate
Goodenough?&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Lawrence!  Lawrence!" imploringly cried a
voice which seemed to him to proceed from the
wainscot to his right.  He started and looked
towards the spot.
</p>

<p>
"Lawrence!"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Ruth to the rescue.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Ruth!" cried the young man in amazement,
"is that you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes.  For the pitying heaven's sake
stay!  See here, I am getting a light."
</p>

<p>
He waited, stock-still, listening to the scratching
sound of the tinder-box, perfectly audible through
the panel's rotten wood; and then, as the thin
yellow streak of light broke through the crack, he
flew to the spot.  "Out of the way, Ruth!" he
cried; and as he spoke he raised his clenched fist
and struck the panel such a sledge-hammer blow
as sent it splintering in all directions, revealing
the figure of Ruth by the light of the candle she
held in her hand, enframed by the woodwork, like
some cunningly painted picture.
</p>

<p>
The illusion, was however, instantly dispelled, as
she stepped eager and breathless to the floor; and
hastening to Goodenough, and falling on her
knees beside him, she carefully opened his coat.
Then tearing her linen kerchief from her neck,
she bound it gently but firmly over the wound
in such a manner as to staunch it and stay the
rushing blood, which, had it continued but a few
moments more, must have drained his life away.
</p>

<br>
RUTH AND LAWRENCE SUCCOUR SHERIFF GOODENOUGH
</p>

<p>
Then having bathed the unfortunate man's face
with some water from a small pitcher which she
motioned to Lawrence to bring her from the
table, she gave a deep and long pent-up sigh, as
she perceived a faint flicker of returning
animation overspread the ashen features.  "So," she
murmured.
</p>

<p>
"Ruth, my poor Ruth," said Lawrence.  "This
is a cruel sight for you."  She shuddered, and
gazed momentarily from Goodenough's face to his.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A terrible sight.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"I'd have given all that's mine, child," he went
on, "to have spared you the sight of it."
</p>

<p>
"Ay," murmured Ruth.  "'Twas terrible, very
very terrible."
</p>

<p>
"Still, my dear," went on Lee philosophically,
"don't take it to heart too much.  One of the
two must always get the worst of it in a fair
stand-up fight.  Eh, mustn't one?
</p>

<p>
"But 'twas no such thing," flashed Ruth.  "The
coward lied, Lawrence&mdash;lied to you.  I saw it
all," she went on shudderingly, "from the hole in
the panel there.  And he&mdash;that man Rumsey&mdash;struck
him unawares.  Think of it, Lawrence; an
unarmed man!"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, hardly that," said Lee, extricating the
poignard from Goodenough's fingers, and
examining it by the light of Ruth's lamp.  "For
he must have struck Rumsey.  See, there is blood
upon this.  It is stained to the very hilt."
</p>

<p>
"And did not Rumsey himself tell you that
he had been barely so much as scratched?" she
said.  "Lawrence, that witnesses against him.
These very words, that he intended to screen his
guilt, would tell the truth against him, even if
there were no tongue to tell what eye has seen."
</p>

<p>
"No, Ruth," said Lee, slowly shaking his head,
and gazing distressfully into the fiery brilliancy
of her eyes and on her pale face, flushed on either
cheek with two spots of burning red.  "You
did not see it.  You must have been dreaming,
child.  It was some hideous nightmare.  Such a
double-dyed treacherous villain as that, no man
could be.  No, Ruth, no.  Say he did not do it,"
he added imploringly.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Bad company.
</span>
</p>

<p>
But she shook her head silently.
</p>

<p>
"It is not possible," he went on.  "He&mdash;Ruth&mdash;that
man and I have touched hands, in&mdash;well,
in token of good fellowship."
</p>

<p>
"And God forgive you then, Lawrence," she
replied.  "As indeed I think he will.  Because
you do not know all.  I am sure you do not
know&mdash;  But hush!" she went on, interrupting
herself; "hush, we must not be found here.  My
father will be back&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, but not yet awhile.  I left them all deep
in&mdash;in their conversation, in the octagon vault."
</p>

<p>
"And did not their conversation interest you,
Lawrence?" demanded she, gazing keenly into his
face.
</p>

<p>
"Why, to confess the truth, not so very much,"
he replied, evading her look.  "And your father&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ay," she said eagerly, as he hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"He said I should mayhap do better to be
coming on, and joining company with Colonel
Rumsey and Master Goodenough here.  I doubt,"
he continued ruminatively, "he suspected they
might be falling to loggerheads; for I never knew
them meet, but what they did always set to
sparring like a pair of Kilkenny cats."
</p>

<p>
"That may be so," answered Ruth; "but this I
am positive of, that those dreadful men wanted
to be rid of you, for they would not have you
know of the shameful deeds they are plotting.
They make but a tool and a cat's-paw of you,
Lawrence.  Ay, but they do," she insisted, in no
way daunted by the wave of offended dignity
Lee's hand made.  "For they know well enough
that your heart is too honourable to stoop to
baseness like theirs."
</p>

<p>
"Tut! tut!&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"They think you but a fool, and right proud I
am they do; for they are knaves and murderers.
Their whole talk to-night was of the best way of
killing the king."
</p>

<p>
"Killing the king?!!"
</p>

<p>
"And the Duke of York When they should
come back next week from Newmarket."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but your father?!" gasped Lee.  "He&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A child's grief.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh do not&mdash;do not speak of him," implored
she, clasping her hands in agony.  "My good, dear
father, Lawrence.  How can we save him?" she
went on in calmer tones.
</p>

<p>
"Save your father?" said Lawrence, gazing in
helpless dejection into the misery of her face.
</p>

<p>
"The king; the king; for to save him, is to
save my father from&mdash;from&mdash;sure, Lawrence, he
must be mad; he must be saved from himself.
And I&mdash;you must do it.  Do you hear?  Do you
understand?"
</p>

<p>
Understanding, Lawrence felt, might come in
time.  For the present, only his ears fully mastered
what Ruth had said, and, helplessly shrugging his
shoulders, he continued to stand gazing vacantly
at the prostrate form of Rumsey's victim.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," she said, her eyes following his,
"you are quite right.  He must not be found
here."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The secret kept.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"But," began Lawrence, "how can we hide him?"
and he glanced towards the door communicating
with hers.  She shook her head.  "'Tis locked;
my father has the key.  He took it this morning.
There is but one way;" and she pointed to the
broken panel&mdash;"this."
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later, had any of the conspirators
returned to the Warder's Room, they would have
found no trace of what had occurred there since
their departure.
</p>

<p>
First, as gently as he was able, Lawrence, with
Ruth's assistance, carried the wounded man to the
secret passage, and laid him on the bed which
she hastily prepared for him from the pillows and
coverings of her own bed.  That done, he stepped
back into the Warder's Room, and having, with
the aid of the pitcher of water, succeeded in
effacing the worst of the ugly tell-tale stain upon the
floor, he set the chairs overturned in the fray
upon their legs again, and then busied himself in
collecting the scattered pieces and splinters of the
broken panel.  Finally, after no small labour,
not lessened by having to reach across the space
occupied by the body of the unconscious Goodenough,
he pieced the panel together, so that it
looked, as he said, keenly surveying it when he
had done, "as if catapults could have made no
impression on it."
</p>

<p>
"I doubt," said Ruth with a faint smile, "one
must not, however, breathe on it too roughly lest
it fall to pieces."
</p>

<p>
"Hark! what's that?" whispered Lawrence in
alarm, as a low curious burring, purring sound in
the room beyond made itself audible.
</p>

<p>
Placing her finger warningly on her lip, Ruth
crossed the floor, and, lifting a piece of tapestry
half-covering one of the walls, she disappeared;
returning, however, almost immediately with a
bottle of cordial in her hand, and a look of relief
on her face.
</p>

<p>
"Maudlin is sleeping as fast as a dormouse,"
she said, pouring a few drops of the bottle's
contents into a cup, and moistening the wounded
man's lips.
</p>

<p>
"But if she should waken?" said Lawrence.
</p>

<p>
"We will take difficulties only as they come,"
answered Ruth.  "'Tis scarce likely to happen
before daybreak.  And long before then, Lawrence,
you must be upon the road."
</p>

<p>
"Upon the road!  To where?" demanded Lawrence aghast.
</p>

<p>
"Newmarket."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The warning to the King.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"The king," she went on, as he continued to
stare at her in speechless astonishment, "must be
warned of this danger that threatens him.  And
'tis you must warn him."
</p>

<p>
"I!" flashed the young man.  "Ruth, what do you
take me for?  I play traitor?  I be a turncoat?"
</p>

<p>
"It is because you are not one," she answered
calmly, "that you will do this.  It is because you
are loyal and true that you will not stand by and
see this crime done."
</p>

<p>
"Betray my oath?"
</p>

<p>
"You never swore to taking the life of a
fellow-creature; least of all your king's."
</p>

<p>
He was silent.  She had indeed spoken the
truth; yet how could he bring himself to acknowledge
to her, what he shrank from admitting to
his own heart, the weakness of that easy nature
of his, which had brought him to this terrible pass?
His one thought had been to "keep neighbourly,"
as he called it, with difficult Master Rumbold.  To
give the maltster offence, was never to see Ruth
again, and that was an unendurable thought.
And so, hardly conscious whither he was drifting,
he suddenly found himself on the edge of this
abyss of crime, from which the soft, sweet, but
resolute voice at his side now warned him back
ere it was too late.  "Choose," she said.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Lawrence decides.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"I cannot," he answered, turning and gazing
sadly down on the pale agonized face which had
never before seemed so dear to him.  "There is
no choice for me, Ruth, but to go."
</p>

<p>
"And Heaven reward you!" she said, a ray of
gladness breaking into her tearful eyes as she laid
her hand on his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Farewell then, Ruth!" he said with an almost
imperceptible shrug; "and if we should never
meet again&mdash;."  He paused.  "Farewell then,
Ruth."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Gone.
</span>
</p>

<p>
And turning away his face, as if he dared not
again meet the sight of hers, he took her little
hand in his and wrung it fast.  Then springing
to the window ledge, he flung the pane wide
open, and planting one foot firmly on the fretted
stonework outside, was lost in the darkness.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br><br>
"STARS AND GARTERS."
</h3>

<p>
The inmates of the King's Arms had been
in bed and asleep full four hours, and
profound silence reigned throughout
its precincts, when, a few moments after
the gatehouse clock had chimed one, a loud
rattling on the panes of Mistress Sheppard's
bedchamber window roused her from uneasy dreams.
</p>

<p>
"Cuther! what a night!" ejaculated she, sitting
up and listening to the sound as it fell again with
increased violence.  "There's hail for you!  Big
as pebble stones, be sure."
</p>

<p>
A third shower made it clear beyond all question
that pebble-stones they were; and rising in
haste, she opened a pane of the lattice and looked
out.
</p>

<p>
"Is that you, Mistress Sheppard?" said a muffled
voice immediately beneath, as the billowy outlines
of her nightcap broke dazzling white amid
the surrounding darkness upon the vision of the
speaker.
</p>

<p>
"And is that you, Master Lee?" sharply replied
the mistress of the hostelry, as her nocturnal
visitor, turning the light of the dark lantern he
carried full upon the casement, revealed at the
same time his own form and features.  "What do
you want?" she went on in dudgeon, "coming
here at this time o' night, bringin' honest folks'
hearts into their mouths, and disturbin' their rest?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," hastily assented Lee; "'tis very late,
I grant you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Early, I suppose you mean," fumed Mistress
Sheppard, clutching the pane, to snap it to again.
"And let me tell you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes! whatever you please, if&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Please!  There's little o' pleasin' in bein'
waked up at this hour."
</p>

<p>
"No, no.  Quite true.  But listen, just listen."
</p>

<p>
"I'll do no such a thing.  What do you want,
Master Lee?"
</p>

<p>
"A horse."
</p>

<p>
"I'll see Sheppard has his horsewhip in nice
trim for you next you come this way," irately
retorted she; "an' be you ten times master o'
Nether Hall."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Stars and garters.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Nay; for that he need be at no trouble,"
laughed Lee, hitting a swish in the air with a
short riding-whip he carried in his other hand.
"I've got my own with me, as luck had it.  And
if not, 'twould have mattered little enough, for 'tis
rarely Stars and Garters needs whip nor spur
either."
</p>

<p>
"Stars and Garters!" gasped Mistress Sheppard.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, 'tis her I'll take, with your good leave,"
calmly returned Lawrence.
</p>

<p>
Now Stars and Garters was the name distinguishing
the pride of the King's Arms, and of
her mistress's heart, a beautiful black mare,
marked with a white star on her left breast, and
a curious ring of white hair below the left knee,
whose match for docility and fleetness of foot was
not to be met with in all the country side; and the
audacity of Lee's proposition took Mistress Sheppard's
breath away.  "Stars and Garters!" ironically
ejaculated she, when at last she recovered it.
"What next, cuther?"
</p>

<p>
"A brace of pistols," began Lee.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Thieves!" she shrieked.  "Murder!&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hold your silly tongue, woman," peremptorily
interrupted Lee.  "What do you take me for?
Don't you know Lawrence Lee yet?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm none so sure that I do," replied she,
recovering all her wonted presence of mind.  "And
I have liked not your ways of late, young man,
and so I tell you."
</p>

<p>
"I doubt they have scarce pleased me better
than they have yourself," said Lee, with a frank
and yet humbled look in his upturned face, which
somehow went straight to the good woman's
heart.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mistress Sheppard hesitates.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"If I know toadstools from mushrooms, he
means honestly," she went on to herself, showing,
however, no signs of capitulating, and sternly
pursing her lips.  "They would ill become your father's
son," she said aloud, "and make sore places in his
heart, as a certain prodigal son's we wot of, did."
</p>

<p>
"And he resolved, did he not, to try and mend
his ways.  So come, Mistress Sheppard, quick
with the stable-door key; there's a good soul; and
Stars and Garters for England and the King."
</p>

<p>
"The king?!" and curl papers all forgotten,
Mistress Sheppard's head craned eagerly down
from the casement.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, he's in danger," nodded Lee, catching up,
as he spoke, a rusty crowbar lying in the grass;
"and there's not a moment to be lost, I tell you.
Shall I break open the stable door and help
myself?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A good start.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"No, no, one instant," she replied, glancing at
the slumbering Sheppard, "one instant and I'll
be down."
</p>

<p>
She was better than her word; and in a few
seconds, attired in strange garments to protect her
from the chilly night-air, she was standing beside
Lee, assisting him to prepare Stars and Garters
for her journey, before the good mare had well
got her wits together.  As, however, she felt
Mistress Sheppard's own plump hands tightening the
saddle-girths round her sleek body, she roused up,
and uttered a loud neigh of pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"Pretty dear!" murmured Mistress Sheppard.
"Hark how eager she is to be upon the road,
bless her!  'Tis more, I'll warrant, than some
Christians'd care about; bein wakened up out
o' their beauty sleep.  Sheppard, now, he'd been
as growly as a bear with a sore head.  Now, then,
up with you, Master Lee.  Here's your pistols,"
she added, thrusting a pair into the holsters.
"You can tell me the tale when you come back.
There's some o't won't be so mighty fresh to me,
I'm thinkin'.  So off with you, and good luck be
your servant."
</p>

<p>
With a hurried wave of the hand Lee clattered
out of the stable, and clearing the low garden
fence by a bound, horse and rider started
"thorough bush, thorough brier," across the fields,
till they attained the high-road, winding on by
the low open country to the fenny Cambridgeshire
wastes, old England's least beautiful part, so
lovers of nature say.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The King's highway.
</span>
</p>

<p>
For another class of folks, however, it possessed
in those days immense attraction; inasmuch as
it formed the highway from London to the
town of Newmarket, which Charles the Second
had made the most important and fashionable
horse-racing place in the kingdom.  He was
accustomed to visit it some five or six times in
the year; establishing his quarters at an old
mansion situated in the middle of the High
Street, which he had purchased from its owner, the
Earl of Ormond, and had caused to be altered
and enlarged, to accommodate himself and his
retinue.  Thither, as may be imagined, like wasps
after honey, swarmed all sorts and conditions of
men, and of women too; from my lord and my lady
in their velvet gowns, to the ragged and jagged
beggar, and worse than these, the footpads, and
"gentlemen of the road," as it was the fashion to
call these thieves on horseback, who infested the
great highways all over the country.
</p>

<p>
It need hardly be said that this one and
particular half hundred miles of road, stretching
between London and Newmarket, was very
carefully attended to by these gentry; and Lee,
as he cantered on, did not forget to keep one
hand near the holsters.
</p>

<p>
Nothing, however, occurred to vary the monotony
of his way, beyond encountering now and
again some solitary pedestrian, probably as honest
and sober as himself, and here and there some few
yards from the road, a group of wayfarers bound
for Newmarket, encamped upon the stunted turf
round the smouldering embers of their hastily
kindled fire.  Towards three o'clock he reached
the large wayside hostelry at Chesterford called
the Blue Bear, where travellers from London
always stopped to change horses.
</p>

<p>
Here, before the big wooden horse-trough in
front of the main door, Lee slackened his rein;
and while Stars and Garters gratefully drank in
the cool clear water, he called for a jack of ale for
his own refreshment.  The drawer was, however,
so slow in getting his drowsy wits together, that
when at last he did hand up the jack; he found
that he was holding it in empty space, and his
customer had disappeared.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
In a mighty hurry.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"He wor in a mighty hurry," grumbled the
man, as he stood listening for a few moments
to the fast dying sounds of the horse's feet, and
then stooped down to grope by the light of the
lantern swinging to the sign-post, after the coin
which Lee had flung down in discharge of the
reckoning for the refreshment he had not stayed
to enjoy.  "Well, he must be a woundly wittol
be sure, or his business is such a rare pressing one,
that he can spare to pass by this;" and he gazed
affectionately into the ale's clear amber deeps,
"as if 'twere no more'n a cup o' fleet milk.  Didn't
the king's own self say, but t'other day, last time
he comed by, and drinked his nippet o't, that
naught o' the stuff in his Whitehall cellars don't
hold a rushlight to't?  Maaster'd be monsus put
about, ef he comed to know of its being scorned so.
Naa, Naa," he went on, putting the jack to his
lips.  "I shudn't dare let him knaw as my fine
young gen'leman didn't drink so much as his
neckum out o't;" and the charitable creature, to
conceal the traveller's shortcoming, took a draught,
so long and deep, that it absorbed two-thirds of
the liquor, "there goes Sinkum&mdash;and," he said,
drawing a long breath of satisfaction, and again
contemplating the interior of the jug, "an' seein'
as him as doan't knaa how to finish a job when
he's begun't, but a poor sort o' creetur, why,"
and tipping up the jack, he emptied the remainder
of its contents down his throat, "there goes
Swankum after 'em."  And having thus vindicated
the honour of the house, he turned in to
renew his interrupted slumbers.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The day dawns.
</span>
</p>

<p>
The rain had long ceased; the air smelt warm
and fragrant, as, soon after daybreak, Lawrence
Lee came in sight of the roof-tops of Newmarket
showing sharp and dark against the clear gray
sky, just rose-tinted with the hues of the rising
sun, whose rays were gilding the smooth turfy
down, till it gleamed like richest velvet.  Very
soft and pleasant it must have felt to the weary
feet of Stars and Garters; though indeed as she
alighted from the flinty road on to the elastic
grass of the course, she carried herself so bravely,
that none of the critical eyes she was now
encountering could have guessed she had been an
hour out of her stall.  Who knows but that she
was conscious that her laurels were at stake; for
already, though it was barely six o'clock, the
course was dotted with knots of gentlemen and
trainers, and a host of hangers-on and loungers
engaged in keen discussion of the pros and cons
of their ventures, or watching the jockeys as they
breathed their magnificent barbs and racers in a
morning gallop.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The horseman.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Who be he, I wunner?" enviously growled a
mounted jockey as Lee dashed past.  "Happen
you caught sight of his colours, my lord?"
</p>

<p>
"Black," laughingly replied the gentleman thus
addressed, a handsome man richly attired in a
becoming morning suit.  "By my faith, black as
the very mischief's self, for aught I could see
besides.  Black as Old Nick and his nag.  Eh,
Master Alworth, was it not so?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay," replied the somewhat elderly, grizzled,
beperiwigged gentleman to whom the other had
appealed, as he leaned with one hand on his
silver-knobbed ebony stick, and shaded his eyes with
the other, to gaze after the strange horse and his
rider.  "Black to a certainty.  But in my poor
judgment the animal was such a Pegasus of grace
and vigour, and his rider's countenance looked
such a goodly one, that if ever our patron George
of England wore a suit of sables."
</p>

<p>
"And bestrode a black charger?" gaily interrupted
the other.
</p>

<p>
"Even so," bowed the elder man, with a
twinkle in his kindly brown eyes; "why, I should
have guessed him to be our champion saint in the
flesh."
</p>

<p>
"Hastening to deliver his country from the
evil-doers," said the nobleman.
</p>

<p>
"'Twould be a miracle indeed if he could do
that," soberly answered Mr. Alworth, "or he a
Quixote of Quixotes to dream of it."
</p>

<p>
"More like he is come to match his Rosinante's
paces with our Fleetfoot's here," rattled on the
other, as he toyed with the nose of the beautiful
racer against whose shoulder he was leaning.
"By the way," he went on, addressing the jockey
in charge of it, "which day is settled for the
match with Woodcock?"
</p>

<p>
"Monday se'nnight, my lord," answered the man.
</p>

<p>
"Does the king stay so long?" asked Alworth,
looking up in some surprise.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
"Pleasure!"
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Long!" groaningly echoed the younger
gentleman.  "'Tis all too short for us poor
Cambridgeshire squires, let me tell you, Master
Alworth.  When the court's back again in London,
we may as soon be the cabbages in our own
kitchen-gardens, for any pleasure there is in life."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A moralist.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Pleasure!" groaningly echoed Master Alworth,
as he turned and faced slowly about towards the
town.  "Pleasure!  Pleasure!  'Tis the watchword
always, and a melancholy one it has grown to be
in my ears, since it no longer pairs off with duty;
as though one should surfeit always on honey,
and eat no bread, and poor England is sickening
sorely of it Pray heaven she be not finding any
plague of quack doctors to try their remedies on
her;" and with a sigh Mr. Alworth pursued his
way.

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br><br>
"A FRIEND IN NEED."
</h3>

<p>
Lawrence Lee had meanwhile reached
the town.  Hardly, however, was he
well into the High Street before he
was forced to rein up, impeded at
every step by the dense throng, crowding as far
ahead as eye could reach.  Epping Fair was a
small thing by comparison with this motley
medley of bawling wagoners, shrill-tongued farmers'
wives haggling over their butter and eggs, screaming
children, chattering apprentices banging about
the shutters of their booths, barking sheep-dogs,
chasing their terrified charges back into the ranks,
braying donkies, clattering of pack-horses stumbling
beneath their burdens over the cobble-stones,
and all to the tune of the several church bells and
clocks clanging out six.  The unaccustomed senses
of Lawrence Lee lost their balance for a moment,
and he closed his eyes to assist their recovery, but
opened them again in a twinkling at the sound
of a voice demanding in not too honeyed accents
where he was "shoving to?"
</p>

<p>
"It's you that's shoving," retorted Lee, looking
down wrathfully at the speaker, whose uplifted
elbow was raised insultingly near Stars and Garters'
nose; and lifting his whip, but letting it fall
again as he perceived what for the first moment
he imagined to be an old man.  A second glance,
however, showed him that the shambling gait,
pasty-coloured cheeks, puckered features, and
lacklustre eyes helped to the composition of an
individual of somewhere about his own number of
years.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Tit for tat.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"I'll teach you and your jade to trample down
gentlemen in the street," growled on this young
old personage.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come!" laughed Lee good-humouredly,
"I didn't mean to do anything of the sort.
You're not hurt, are you?"
</p>

<p>
"No thanks to you if I'm not," sourly returned
the other.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come now.  Did you get out of bed left
leg foremost?" again laughed Lee.
</p>

<p>
"Right or left," ingenuously yawned the other,
whom a game of basset had detained from between
the blankets far into the small hours; "if they've
been in bed at all, it's as much as they have."
</p>

<p>
Lawrence Lee's case was in degree a similar
one; and his own weary sensations made him feel
some sort of indulgence for this individual's sulky
humour.  "Oh, that accounts for it," he said to
himself.
</p>

<p>
"Accounts for what?" fired back the other,
catching the <i>sotto voce</i> comment.
</p>

<p>
"For your being so polite&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well," fumed the other, "people who have
any manners never stop gawking in the middle of
their remarks.  It an't good breeding."
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it now?  Well, for your looking so fresh
and spruce then, I took you for a scarecrow."
</p>

<p>
"And I take you for a clodpole," glared back
his new acquaintance with an affected laugh, "to
whom 'twill be a real charity to give twopence
a week to learn manners."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Crooked answers.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"That begins at home; keep it for your own
necessities, my friend.  You see I know how to be
generous.  But if you're really so amiably
disposed towards me&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Go about your business."
</p>

<p>
"That I shall be able to do, when I have gone
miles enough to find some one with a tongue in
his head, civil enough to direct me to the king's
palace."
</p>

<p>
The other opened his dull eyes in a
preternaturally wide-awake manner, and bestowed a
scrutinizing stare on Lawrence.  "What may you
want there?"
</p>

<p>
"Folks with an ounce of manners never meet
question with question.  It isn't good
breeding&mdash;not in the part I come from."
</p>

<p>
"And where&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Where do I come from?  That's a question
whose answer will improve by keeping.  So out
of the way, friend, if you can't direct me."
</p>

<p>
"Can't!" hysterically giggled the other.  "Ho!
Come, I like that Ho, ho!  Ha, ha!  That's rich.
Don't you know who I am, friend?"
</p>

<p>
"Haven't a notion," said Lawrence, looking
away from him up and down the street, and
anxiously surveying its snug but
unpalatial-looking houses.
</p>

<p>
"How do you conceive, I wonder, how I come
by these, my good fellow?" he went on, pointing
downwards.
</p>

<p>
"Padded a bit, aren't they?" said Lawrence,
driven to utter the passing comparison he had
already unconsciously instituted in his own mind,
between the remarkable symmetry and plumpness
of the pair of silken-clad calves, and the meagre
upper proportions of their proprietor.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A grand personage.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Psha!  Bah!  These, I mean;" and then Lawrence
perceiving that not the legs, but the pair of
fine blue cloth breeches covering them, were the
indicated objects, said, honestly enough, he doubted
not, nay, he was sure they were, by many a long
mile, the very finest small-clothes he had ever seen,
and must have cost a pretty penny.
</p>

<p>
"Out of His Majesty's own purse," replied the
other, waxing sweet-tempered as any cat rubbed
under the chin, and elevating his insignificant nose,
as he buttoned on the coat he had carried
inside-out over his arm, and which Lawrence now
perceived to be of the same cerulean hue and
glittering embroideries as the nether garments.
"Now," he went on, falling well back on to the
heels of his resetted shoes, and strutting forward
a few paces.  "Now do you know who I am?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't the ghost of a notion, I tell you,"
said Lawrence, watching the exhibition with
absent impatient eyes, into which, however, a
gleam of hopeful intelligence began to dawn; "but
think I know what you are.  One of the king's
lackey fellows."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The lackey.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Sirrah!"
</p>

<p>
"For sure!" and Lawrence slapped his knee,
and his face grew full of animation.  "How came
I not to recognize the cut of you sooner, when
I've seen any number of you hanging as thick as
thieves scores of times&mdash;about the King's Arms,
swilling down its cider&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"To which King's Arms do you refer, my good
fellow?" lisped the lackey.  "There's hundreds
of 'em scattered over the country."
</p>

<p>
"Opposite Master Rumbold's."
</p>

<p>
"Never heard of the fellow," said the lackey,
airily stroking his little chin.  "Hang me now
if I have.  Shouldn't be able to tell him from
Adam, renounce me now if I should.  Rumbold?
Rumbold?"
</p>

<p>
"Of the Rye House."
</p>

<p>
"Never so much as heard of the place," said
the lackey, and slowly shaking his head with
the action and beatifically vacuous smile of a
Chinese image.
</p>

<p>
"That shows how little you know the king,
then, for he knows it well enough," contemptuously
returned Lawrence, "as well as he does
one of his palaces.  'Twas a palace too itself, once
upon a time; and 'tis big enough for the
squinniest eyes to see."
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
"Cock-a-doodle-doo!" screeched the other.
"Hear the clodhopper&mdash;all his geese are swans.  I
apprehend you'll be for telling me next that your
Rye House is as fine an edifice as this;" and he
languidly extended his hand in the direction of
the house beneath whose walls they stood.
</p>

<p>
"This!" echoed Lawrence, laughing merrily.
"This dog-hole of a place hold a candle to our old
Rye House!  Come," and briskly twitching Stars
and Garters by the rein, he was about to push
on, "how much farther to the king's palace?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mr. Alworth.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Under this archway and across the yard,"
said a voice immediately behind him.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence's face fell blankly.  If he had not
quite anticipated walls of gold and columns of
ivory, he had conceived of something statelier
than this mean, patched-up-looking house.  "I
thank you, sir," he contrived, however, to say at
last, turning to the speaker and lifting his cap
deferentially, as he perceived him to be an elderly
man, somewhat tall and still fairly robust, in an
iron-gray periwig, and with a genial glance in his
keen gray eyes, overshadowed by brows still thick
and dark.  The Mr. Alworth, in fact, whose
acquaintance we have already made upon the heath.
</p>

<p>
"And if," continued Lawrence, "you will add
to your obligation by telling me how I may come
to speak with the king&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ho!" chuckled the lackey; "renounce me if
ever I heard the like of that!"
</p>

<p>
"I am no courtier," answered Mr. Alworth,
suppressing the lackey's outbreak by a look;
"but I am acquainted with many that are," he
went on with a flicker of a smile; "and I often
hear them say that His Majesty is not difficult of
access, provided you have, of course, some letter of
commendation."
</p>

<p>
"Not the ghost of one," said Lee with another
blank stare.
</p>

<p>
"Ha! ha!" grinned the lackey in vast enjoyment
of Lawrence's discomfiture.  "A pretty
fellow!  What do you say to that, Mr. Alworth?"
</p>

<p>
"Silence, Mr. Flippet," said Alworth sternly.
"You should have provided yourself, my friend,"
he went on, turning again to Lee.  "You have
doubtless influential neighbours&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!" said Lawrence, scratching his curls.
</p>

<p>
"Standing well at court?" continued Mr. Alworth.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't know so much about that.
H'm, h'm&mdash;the fact is," stammered on Lawrence,
"I&mdash;you see, I came off in&mdash;in just a bit of a
hurry."
</p>

<p>
"And the more haste the less speed.  You will
know that, when those brown locks of yours have
got a silver streak or two among them.  Well,
I don't know what's to be done," he added
cogitatively.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
How to see the King.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Go back where he came from, like a bad
penny," interjected the hugely delighted Flippet,
but in a key too low to catch the ear of Alworth,
of whom he stood in wholesome awe.  That
personage having, as he believed, and not without
good cause, power to mar or to advance his
fortunes by reason of his intimate acquaintance
with many whose time was passed about the
presence of the king.  And Mr. Flippet was fond of
his place, in spite of his complaints concerning its
arduous and fatiguing duties.  These consisted in
the daily washing and combing of a couple of little
dogs, respectively named Azor and Médor, two
prime favourites among the posse of snubby-nosed,
silky-coated, fringy-pawed, lilliputian
spaniels which his majesty loved to have about
him.  As to the daily airing necessary for their
health, the king himself was their nurse; and the
toilets of the little creatures completed, Mr. Flippet
was lord of his time, of which the portion not
devoted to slumber, eating and drinking, and the
basset-table, he spent in dawdling about.
</p>

<p>
"I fear there is nothing for it," said Mr. Alworth
after a brief speculative silence, "but for
you to return home, and obtain such a letter of
introduction.  'Tis a case, I doubt, where, as the
old saying has it, 'the longest way round is the
shortest way there.':
</p>

<p>
"Go back!" cried Lee in dismay.  "Thirty
miles if 'tis a yard.  Sir! sir! and 'tis a matter of
life and death!"
</p>

<p>
"That's what they all say when they want to
be fleecing the king or you; an't it, Master
Alworth?" sneered the lackey.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Flippet's duties.
</span>
</p>

<p>
The remark was, however, lost on Alworth,
who was absorbed in the study of Lawrence's
countenance; but turning his eyes on Flippet at
last, he said: "Mr. Flippet, you are a person of
considerable influence with the gentlemen of the
bed-chamber&mdash;according to your own account."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Brought to book.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Alworth!" blushingly rejoined Flippet,
"you're too kind to say so; renounce me if
you're not."
</p>

<p>
"Denounce you, you mean sir!" sternly said
Alworth.  "And that, let me tell you, is what
I had more than half a mind for, when I heard
those two wretched little dogs yelping in the
stable yonder to the tune of a switch, as I passed
some two hours since."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Alworth!" yelped Flippet in his
turn, and falling on his knees, regardless of the
puddles; "you'll never tell of me, Mr. Alworth.
'Twould be a hanging matter for me, if it came
to his majesty's ears.  Oh!  Mr. Alworth, the lazy,
pampered little beasts put me out of patience, and
I&mdash;I&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If all the pampered animals were treated by
their deservings, some would come worse off than
Azor and Médor.  Get up, you foolish fellow.
You cowardly pretence of a man, chastising two
poor helpless little dogs.  Don't let me hear of it
again."
</p>

<p>
"You shall not, Mr. Alworth," whined Flippet,
inwardly resolved that next time he had occasion
to "correct" his charges, it should be with closed
windows and stuffed keyholes.  "You shall not!
Oh! don't tell of me this once," he went on in an
agony of entreaty, "and I'll&mdash;I'll stand on my
head to do you a service."
</p>

<p>
"You'll serve me better," smiled Alworth, "by
keeping it where it is, and giving your brains a
chance of devising some means of bringing this
young man before the king, without an instant's
delay."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I&mdash;" gasped Flippet.  "Oh! yes, to be
sure; only, you see&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes or no," said Alworth inflexibly.
</p>

<p>
"Anything to oblige you&mdash;" began the unfortunate
lackey.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A friend not at court.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Very good," nodded Alworth.  "'Tis but a
small enough favour.  But for my own part, I
have never so much as seen his majesty face to
face; and should have to be beholden to some of
my friends for introduction to him myself, though
we are near enough neighbours, and have had
some business together.  But my name, sir," he
went on, turning again to Lee, "is but plain
Richard Alworth.  To be heard of across the way
yonder, over against the parish church, at the sign
of the 'Silver Leopard.'"
</p>

<p>
"And my name," said Lawrence, "is Lee&mdash;Lawrence Lee."
</p>

<p>
"Of the Nether Hall Farm, by Hoddesdon?"
cried Alworth, a sudden light dispelling all the
little clouds of mystification in the keen eyes
transfixing Lawrence.
</p>

<p>
"The same," nodded Lee, as he dismounted
from his horse; "at your service."
</p>

<p>
"The son of my good old friend and comrade!"
and now tears glistened up into the eyes.  "The
loyalest heart that ever beat," he went on, seizing
the hand of Lawrence.  "We fought side by side
on Worcester Field; and he was struck down.
Heaven does so often take the best early back to
itself.  Well, well, he died worthily&mdash;as a man
may be proud to die&mdash;for King and Country.
You look your father's son," he went on, scanning
the young man keenly; "every inch of you.  But
I must not detain you now; and Mr. Flippet
here is, I can see, dying to acquit himself of his
little obligation.  So fare you well, Master Lee, till
you favour me with your company at supper
to-night.  Nay, come, come; but I'll take no
denial.  Don't forget the 'Silver Leopard.'  Anybody
will direct you.  I'm well known.  Your
servant, my lord," he went on, acknowledging
the salutation of a gaily-dressed gallant, who
thereupon linked his arm familiarly into that of
Alworth, and led him away engaged in earnest
conversation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The power of the purse.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Ay, there they go," muttered Flippet; "hand-in-glove,
of course, like he is with 'em all.  That's
what it is to have your pockets well lined,"
continued Flippet, thrusting his hands into his own
highly-decorated, but, thanks to the past night's
little amusements, absolutely empty ones.
</p>

<p>
"A wealthy man?" said Lawrence.
</p>

<p>
"That's not the word for it," enviously replied
Flippet.  "No courtier?  No.  I'll warrant Richard
Alworth, the goldsmith, wouldn't change his
mouse-coloured broadcloth for all their fine
feathers.  But he's a good sort I don't say
anything against him.  Leastways he would be a
good sort if he wasn't such a confounded,
pig-headed, obstinate old&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Stopped in time.

<p>
"Come, Mr. Flippet, when you're ready," interrupted Lee.

CHAPTER XXI.
<br><br>
"A FRIEND INDEED."
</h3>

<p>
Passing beneath the archway, where
Lawrence Lee delivered Stars and
Garters into the charge of a groom,
who advanced to receive her in
obedience to a lofty gesture from Mr. Flippet, the
two crossed the courtyard, which was handsomely
paved with octagon-shaped black and white
marble flags, and decorated with orange-trees set
in huge painted china tubs, and statuary
emblematic of the amusement which the king came
hither to pursue.
</p>

<p>
Not by the main door, whose low double flight
of winding steps was protected by a rail of cast
iron, wrought into grotesque shapes of centaurs
and winged horses, but by a little side postern,
half hidden in one of the irregular angles of the
building, Lee and his companion gained a dark
vestibule; ascending thence by a narrow break-neck
flight of stone stairs to a corridor above.
Pursuing its tortuous turns, it brought them
in sight of a fair-sized gallery, whose gaily gilded
balustrades and painted walls catching the pale
yellow rays of the morning sun, presented a
garish, confusing picture to the somewhat wearied
senses of Lee.  It would, indeed, have been a
hard matter to find a resting-place for the eyes
amidst the ever moving throng of richly dressed
figures, conspicuous among which were numbers
who were clad like his companion in silver-laced
blue livery.  These deftly threaded their way
to and fro, bearing salvers of burnished silver
loaded with cut-glass silver-gilt flagons, and
brilliantly painted coffee and chocolate pots of
oriental china.  Pressing on after Flippet, or to
speak with absolute correctness, dragging Flippet
onward, Lee soon found himself in the very thick
of the chattering, giggling, simpering crowd of
fine ladies and gentlemen who were bidding their
good-morrows to each other, and exchanging sweet
compliments.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
An awkward fix.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"A nice trim he's in," dismally grumbled
Flippet to himself, as he marked the disgustful
stares and supercilious smiles of this butterfly
bevy, at the stranger's mud-bespattered attire, and
the terror and alarm with which they snatched
their skirts and ruffles from possibility of contact
with it.  "A sweet trim truly for an audience!
It's all mighty fine for Master Alworth to say,
'Flippet do that,' and 'Flippet do this,' as if I
was any fetching and carrying poodle dog; but&mdash;"
and the gaze of silent despair he was bestowing
on the rich blood-red Genoa velvet curtains which
now stayed their progress, was more eloquent
than words.
</p>

<p>
No one knew better than himself that the
brazen gates of an ogre's castle could more easily
be broken through, and a couple of dragons
sooner mollified, than that pair of suave-looking
six-foot-high personages, habited in blue and
silver, and wielding slender white wands in their
delicate hands; for did not they guard the sacred
way conducting straight to the private apartments
of the king?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
An awkward introduction.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"And what may be your business this morning,
Mr. Flippet?" demanded one of these personages,
"and who may be your friend?" he added,
glaring at Lawrence Lee.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I&mdash;" stammered the lackey.  "He's no
friend of mine.  Renounce me if he is, and&mdash;and&mdash;it's
no business of mine, I assure you, Mr. Usher,
none whatever."
</p>

<p>
"Then don't meddle with it," laughed Mr. Usher,
as he looked far over Mr. Flippet's head into the
gallery's middle distance; "but mind your manners,
and stand out of the way.  And you too young
gentleman," he went on addressing Lee.  "Don't
you see who's a coming?"
</p>

<p>
He emphasized these words with such a sudden
lunge of his staff of office at the objects nearest
to him, which happened to be the unfortunate
Flippet's legs, that the lackey shifted aside in
blind terror, and fell stumbling against Lee.
Unprepared for the shock, Lawrence in his turn
must, but for a dexterous twist which regulated
his balance, have lain sprawling his length at
the very feet of a lady, advancing towards the
curtained way, accompanied by a group of some
half dozen more ladies, who remained standing
a pace or two in the rear of her, as she came to a
forced halt.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Queen.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Fortunately these awkward man[oe]uvres brought
about no worse mishap than the brushing to the
floor of a little book which the foremost lady had
held lightly in her hand.
</p>

<p>
Crimsoning with shame to the roots of his dark
curls, Lawrence stooped down, and picking up the
book was about to present it to the lady, when
he felt the skirts of his coat pulled from behind
with such violence, that a second and still more
deplorable misadventure must inevitably have
occurred, had not the lady averted it with a
peremptory, but still gracious gesture of her small
ivory-white hand.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, gentlemen, you are unmannerly," she
said, in tones of gentle remonstrance, and whose
accents sounded strangely in the ears of the
Hertfordshire farmer.  "What is the meaning
of this?" she went on, her dark eyes kindling
with indignation and surprise, as they traversed
the circle of ladies and gallants whom the
disturbance had drawn to the spot "What is
the meaning of it?" reiterated she, receiving the
book from Lee's hands with a gracious inclination
of her head.  The onlookers simpered vacuously
at each other.
</p>

<p>
"Your majesty&mdash;" began the Usher.
</p>

<p>
The Queen!  In spite of the strange heart-beating
sensation which then seized Lawrence,
his curiosity, or more correctly interest, was still
sufficiently his master, to permit of his bearing
away in his memory the enduring picture of
Catharine of Braganza, the not too happy wife of the
merry careless Charles the Second.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Court ladies.
</span>
</p>

<p>
How was it that this middle-aged, olive-complexioned
Portuguese lady, whose mouth would
have been prettier had not her teeth projected
somewhat too far, and whose chief beauty lay in
her magnificent dark eyes, though indeed her small
figure was slender and graceful enough&mdash;brought
comely English Ruth Rumbold to his mind?
Only so it did.  Could it be some association
which similarity of dress brings?  True enough,
Ruth's holiday gown and petticoat were but of
tiffany, and her cobweb cambric neckerchief only
hem-stitched neat as needle could do it; whereas
the queen's petticoat was of finest silver gray
taffety, bordered like its tawny brown brocade
overskirt, with pinkish silken embroidery, and the
broad fine linen collar covering her shoulders,
and reaching close round her slender neck, was
edged with magnificent Spanish lace.  For the
rest, Lawrence with his masculine ignorance of
women's fallals could not have enlightened you at
all; but had he presumed to ask the surrounding
court ladies, they would have uttered little scornful
shrieks, screwed up their red lips&mdash;rosy as salve
could make them&mdash;tossed back their glossy straying
ringlets, and told him that the queen was a
starched old frump, who stuck to the odiously
dowdy fashions of thirty years ago and more, when
melancholy Charles the First was king.  Yet
perhaps after all, it was not the modest style of her
dress, but something in the womanly sweet
composure of her speech and bearing, that crowns all
women, old and young, plain and beautiful, with
a grace of its own; that reminded Lawrence
Lee of his little love, won his allegiance to the
king's wife, and sealed his determination to save
the king, or die in the attempt; let this butterfly
swarm sneer and simper as they pleased, and
half draw their rapiers, as they were beginning
to do, muttering: "Insolence," and "Upstart,"
and the rest of it; while the ladies giggled
hysterically, and cried, "Malapert," and the usher
continued to stammer on in dire confusion:&mdash;"You
see&mdash;that is, your Majesty will compre&mdash;that is,
of course apprehend&mdash;that is to say&mdash;ahem&mdash;understand
that here is some plot&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
"A plot!  A plot!"
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay.  Quite so," eagerly interrupted
Lawrence, and casting grateful looks at the usher.
"That is it&mdash;a plot.  A vile, infamous plot&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Sirrah!" frowned the usher.  "A plot between
this fellow Flippet here," he went on, again
addressing the queen.  "Your Majesty knows him
well,"&mdash;and he pointed his wand at the now
trembling nurse of Azor and Médor, "and this
stranger here, to thrust themselves into the
presence of his Majesty."
</p>

<p>
"Wherefore?" demanded the queen; and the
inquiry was caught up and echoed on every side.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven knows," groaned the usher, turning
up his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"And not heaven only," cried the excited
young man.  "For 'tis a hellish conspiracy to
murder the king&mdash;Madam&mdash;your Majesty"&mdash;he
hurriedly continued, in a voice tremulous with
agitation; and utterly unconscious of the sneers
and uplifted hands of the by-standers, he threw
himself at the queen's feet.  "'Tis a matter of life
and death to the king.  I must see him.  You
who are all potent with him&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Listen to that now!" giggled the ladies.
</p>

<p>
"Entreat&mdash;implore him to grant me an audience,"
and he caught the queen's skirt.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come.  This troublesome fellow is too
insufferable," cried a young gentleman springing
forward, and seizing Lee roughly by the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Queen listens.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Hands off, my Lord of Grafton," sternly cried
the queen, who saw, or thought she saw in all this
pretended zeal, the veiled intention she only too
frequently experienced, of setting her will at
naught.  The young nobleman slunk back, looking
crestfallen and louring.  "Go forward, sir,"
continued Catherine, waving back the rest, and
motioning Lee to precede her along the corridor.
</p>

<p>
The curtain fell behind them, and Lee found
himself alone with the queen and her ladies.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sovereign lord the king,<br>
  Whose word no man relies on;<br>
  He never said a foolish thing,<br>
  And never did a wise one.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The king's private apartments in his
ramshackle, patched-together, wandering
old hunting-lodge, presented a vastly
different scene from the like sacred
precincts by courtesy misnamed "private" at
Whitehall.  There up to his bed-rails all was buzz and
bustle; here in Newmarket his love of ease, and
his good-will and pleasure, were so far consulted
and respected that the swarm of courtly hangers-on
was kept at bay by those velvet hangings; and
Lee heard not a sound in the corridor they had
entered but the rustling of the ladies' gowns and
the echo of his own footfall.
</p>

<p>
Pausing before a door about midway along the
right-hand wall of the corridor, and which bore
on its heavy ebony panels the gilded royal cognizance
and initials, the queen pushed it open with
her own hand, and, followed by her companions,
entered the apartment beyond.  It was an oblong
chamber, sparsely lighted at its further end by a
couple of tall windows, in whose deep recesses
some half-dozen lackeys were yawningly watching
what might be going on in the courtyard below.
At sight, however, of the queen they hurried
into rank, and proceeded to throw open with much
ceremony another double door, which brought
them into a room, or rather vestibule of circular
form, panelled with looking-glass deeply sunken
in heavy gilded scrollwork, and which reflected
in ghastly distorted fashion the gaudy elephantine
ugliness of the crimson silk and ormolu furniture
of the latest French fashion, ranged formally
round the windowless walls; for the light
of heaven only found its way into this dreary
apartment through the blue and orange-coloured
panes of a skylight let into the centre of its painted
domed roof.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The King's chambers.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Here the queen paused; and having with a gesture
dismissed the lackeys, and desired her ladies
to await her return, she passed on alone with
Lawrence Lee into a long straight corridor, richly
carpeted and lighted by bull's-eye windows of
coloured glass not larger than those of a ship's
cabin.  The silence and tortuous ways of the
place oppressed Lee's senses like a nightmare
dream; and he began to think that a guide through
its dim passages was not altogether a mere courtly
superfluity, but rather a thing of absolute
necessity.  "I'd sooner undertake to be finding my
way for the first time through our hornbeam
maze at home than in and out of all these
crinkum-crankums," thought he; "and if this be
your King Charles's merry court, give me the
Nether Hall kitchen."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Under the royal eye.
</span>
</p>

<p>
A silvery peal of merriment, that rippled like
dancing water on the sonorous laughter of men's
voices, dispelled Lee's too hastily formed
conclusions.  He glanced at the queen.  Was it his
fancy?  or did a shadow momentarily darken the
composure of her face as she lifted the gorgeously
embroidered Indian silk hangings before which
they now stood, and with a sign to Lee to keep
close, stepped over the threshold of a low-ceiled
but spacious chamber, whose wainscot of ebonized
wood was enriched with paintings, and gilded
carved reliefs of fruit and flowers entwining
emblems of the chase.  Here at all events was no
lack of life; for the apartment was thronged with
persons of both sexes, and all so engrossed in talk
and merriment that they did not observe the
entrance of the queen, until it was marked by
the quick glance of one pair of eyes, which all
the others had a trick of following, despite their
seeming carelessness.  The expression in the face
of the owner of these eyes, who was seated near
the fire which burned upon the hearth curiously
built into one of the corners of the room, soon
brought to their senses the merry company nearest
the door; and, subsiding into a decorous gravity,
they fell apart into a sort of double thickset
hedgeway of feathers and furbelows reaching clear
up to the stone-canopied fireplace, whose logs,
burning brilliantly between the brazen dogs, cast
their light upon the swarthy countenance of King
Charles the Second, where he sat leaning carelessly
back in a tall carved elbow-chair, attired in
a hunting suit of darkest olive velvet.
</p>

<p>
"Your majesty is astir betimes this morning,"
he said, rising a little hurriedly, and addressing
the queen in tones which were not wanting in
courtesy, if they might be in cordiality.  "You
have been to church?" he added, glancing at the
little book in her hand.
</p>

<p>
The queen bowed her head.  "'Tis the feast of
my patron saint, Catharine, your majesty will
remember," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Odds fish!" ejaculated Charles, vexedly cud
gelling his brows, for he had in no wise
remembered; and a flush of something like compunction
crossed his swarthy features.  "You have our
hearty wishes, Catharine, for its many happy
returns."
</p>

<p>
A lightless smile curved the queen's lips as she
acknowledged with a deep inclination of her head
the chorus of voices endorsing this tardy felicitation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The King's breakfast.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"And now," continued Charles with a gesture
of his hand towards the breakfast tables, glittering
in their costly confusion, while his eyes travelled
rather regretfully down over his long buff
riding-boots, "does not your majesty propose to stay
and breakfast with us?  It is true&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That you have breakfasted," interrupted the
queen with another faint smile.  "Nay, I take it
my absence will be more esteemed.  Oh! no protests,
gentlemen," she went on, lifting her hand as
the polite chorus was repeated, "for I perceive, as
to be sure I only anticipated, that you are all
booted and spurred for your day's pleasure.  And
I had no intention of coming here to&mdash;to spoil it.
But on my way from chapel this young gentleman&mdash;"
and she made a motion towards Lawrence
Lee&mdash;"a supplicant for a word with your
majesty,&mdash;crossed it.  And though some of your majesty's
people would have denied him, his business&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Business!" groaned the king, sinking down
again into his chair with a cavernous yawn.
</p>

<p>
"Was urgent, he said."
</p>

<p>
"We have no leisure for it;" and Charles's
black brows knitted with angry impatience.  "Let
him carry it to Whitehall."
</p>

<p>
"He says," persisted Catharine, "that it
concerns your majesty personally."
</p>

<p>
"Then its standing over can give the less
offence.  If we alone are concerned&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Lawrence speaks out.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"We!" cried Lee, breaking to the front and
sending all ceremony to the winds, and his
bashfulness after it.  "We!  'Tis there all the whole
matter lies.  'Tis just because your majesty is
'We,' and never can be 'I.'  The King is England,
and England is the King!"
</p>

<p>
Charles's brow relaxed into an expression of
amused curiosity at the earnestness of the speaker.
"Your sentiments are loyal at all events," he
said, as his dark eyes considered the young man's
appearance from beneath their heavy lids.  "Are
we to feel assured that your heart is no traitor to
them?"
</p>

<p>
Lee blushed.  "'Tis my heart," he replied,
"that bids me entreat your majesty to hear me."
</p>

<p>
"And a sweet heart I think it must be, by my
faith, and your red cheeks," merrily laughed the
king.  "And a brave honest meaning one, I will
not doubt.  But we have seen too many shadows
and mumbo-jumbos in our life, to be afraid of
them.  And," continued the king, glancing round
at the company, all ready equipped for their
expedition, "we are detaining these gentlemen, and the
ladies too, from their pleasure."
</p>

<p>
"They could be spared," hopefully said Lee,
who desired nothing better than to speak alone
with the king.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Suspicion.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"But it is suspicious indeed&mdash;this!" cried a
beautiful Frenchified-looking lady, coming close
up beside Charles, and darting angry glances on
the young farmer from her brilliant eyes.  "His
majesty loves not so well tête-à-têtes with persons
of your condition," she added in haughty tones.
</p>

<p>
"He might hold them with less honest folks,
madam," returned the queen still more haughtily.
"And he asks not your leave, I doubt, to speak
with his own English-born subjects."
</p>

<p>
"Come, come!" said the king, as the lady at
his side poutingly drew a step back; "this grows
troublesome.  What is the bottom of your
business with us, my good friend?"
</p>

<p>
"Treason!" curtly answered Lawrence.
</p>

<p>
"Soho!  And assassination to follow&mdash;eh?  The
old parrot screech," he went on, as Lee nodded.
"Some new plot to rid the world of our sacred
presence.  Is that it?"
</p>

<p>
"And of his Grace of York's, your majesty's
august brother."
</p>

<p>
"Why, that of course," laughed Charles, casting
a mischievous glance at a sombre-browed gentleman
seated near his own chair; "for to a dead
certainty no man in England would take my life
to make thee king, James."
</p>

<p>
"Then," said the duke, accepting his brother's
jest with a sullen smile, "if this young man is to
be trusted&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, IF," chorused several of the impatient
company.  "There your grace hits the bull's-eye.  IF."
</p>

<p>
"We are both doomed men," imperturbably
concluded the duke.  "And when," he added,
addressing Lee, "is this to be?"
</p>

<p>
"Ten days hence.  On your return from this
place."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Charles wakes up.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Ods-fish!  So they would take us red hot
in our pleasures, would they?  The scurvy
crew! and where, prithee?" demanded Charles.
</p>

<p>
"Near by Hoddesdon.  Over against the Rye House."
</p>

<p>
"The Rye House!  Is not that how they call
the ancient moated place that looks upon Master
Izaak Walton's favourite old hostelry on the banks
of the Lea?"
</p>

<p>
"The same, your majesty."
</p>

<p>
"And belongs, if we mistake not, to one Rum&mdash;Rum&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;bold.  Richard Rumbold, a maltster."
</p>

<p>
"Ay; a prick-eared, Puritan-looking, malignant
of a fellow, your majesty," interposed a twinkling-eyed
gentleman, "who owns 'one daughter, passing
fair,' as the dull old person does in the dull
old play we all went to sleep over, a week or two
since.  Yes, yes; I remember her charming face
well, and how the old curmudgeon came and
dragged her in, sans cérémonie, from the little
postern in the big red wall, where she was standing
as pretty a framed picture as Lely or Sir Godfrey
might make, to see your majesty's coach pass by.
I' faith!  I recall her well."
</p>

<p>
"And your memory on such points is a proverb,
my Lord of Dorset," laughed the king; "but
in truth I remember myself thinking the picture
so exquisite, that I intended asking who she was
of the good hostess of the King's Arms, one
Mistress&mdash;Mistress&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A slip in a name.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Sheppard," prompted Lee.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, Sheppard, to be sure.  A murrain befall
me for forgetting the name of one who always
professes such loyalty.  Professes, friend," added
the king in a significant tone.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis but the expression of what her heart
feels," replied Lawrence warmly.  "Mistress
Sheppard is as loyal as the sign that hangs before
her door.  Though for Master Sheppard&mdash;h'm,
well, 'tis no matter," and Lawrence came to a
dead halt.
</p>

<p>
"We like not half-told tales, friend," sternly
said the duke.  "What of this fellow Sheppard?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, I assure you, sir&mdash;my lord&mdash;your
highness," floundered Lee.  "Nothing.  He is a
man of straw, a poor weathercock of a creature a
lamb could not fear."
</p>

<p>
"Then whom the plague are we to fear?" demanded
Charles testily.
</p>

<p>
"Not the old gentleman, I suppose, who fathers
the pretty daughter, and hasn't a thought beyond
her, and his rye-sacks, and his homily books, if
his face goes for anything.  Faith! 'twas as sour
looking as if't had risen out of his own yeast
tubs!" cried the earl.
</p>

<p>
"Ha! ha! ha!" laughed the company, who made
a point of always greeting the very smallest sally
of my Lord of Dorset's wit with shouts of
laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Not he, friend?" said the king, who had not
failed to remark Lee's silence and slightly confused
downcasting of the eyelids during Lord Dorset's
speech.  "By the by," he went on, still scanning
the young man's face and figure with a sort of
indolent curiosity, "what may be your name?  All
this time we have not heard that.  Who may
you be?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A reminder.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Lawrence Lee, of the Nether Hall Farm by
Hoddesdon," answered Lee proudly.  "My father
served your majesty's father well.  Though, 'tis
possible, your majesty may not recall his name."
</p>

<p>
Short memory on such points, even when such
services touched still closer home, and had been
rendered to himself, was far from uncommon in
Charles.  Notwithstanding, his dark eyes kindled
genially as he continued to look at the young
man, and the bantering smile grew softer.  "And
Nether Hall," he said, "neighbours the house of
Master Rum&mdash;Rum&mdash;how the plague did the fellow
come by such a heathenish name?"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis fortunate," said the irrepressible Earl of
Dorset, "that so fair a damsel as his daughter
is scarce like to wear it to the end of her
days."
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said the king, holding up a rebukeful
finger at the earl, as he noted Lee's flushing cheek,
and the ill-pleased gnawing of his nether lip;
"that quite clearly concerns not our deciding;
for here we have, it seems, a question of treason,
and this pretty Mistress&mdash;Mistress&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Sorry jesting.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Ruth," said Lee in a low tone; "Ruth is her
Christian name."
</p>

<p>
"I' faith! and such a sweet one, too, that it
covers all the sinning of her father's&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Lee started.  "I said not&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You interrupt," smiled the king; "'twould go
hard indeed for us all if fair Mistress Ruth should
prove traitress."
</p>

<p>
"Your majesty has not a loyaller heart in all
your kingdom than Ruth Rumbold," said Lee,
conquering down his agitation.
</p>

<p>
"Say you so?" merrily returned the king; "then
with such fair ladies for our champions, how can
we fear the blackest treason in all Hertforshire?
Here we have valiant Mistress Sheppard on one
side of the road, and the loyal Mistress of the
Rye House on the other&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, be serious, Charles," frowned the duke,
out of all patience at his brother's levity.
</p>

<p>
"Pah!  I cannot," as impatiently returned the
king, taking as he spoke a pair of riding-gloves
from the table, and beginning to draw them on.
"These would-be scares sicken one.  'Tis like the
shepherd crying wolf."
</p>

<p>
"And when the real one came at last&mdash;" began
the duke.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The royal pleasure.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Ods-fish, man.  For pity's sake, let us have
no more of this," interrupted the king.  "The
lad means honestly enough, no doubt.  But he
has been picking up some ale-house tale, and got
a nightmare of it, depend on't.  Stay you, my
dear brother, if you will, to hear it out.  And
hark you, when 'tis ended, don't forget to see the
lad falls to and picks up a good breakfast for his
melancholy entertainment of your grace.  Do you
propose to accompany us this morning, Catharine?"
he continued, turning to the queen.
</p>

<p>
"If your majesty commands," she answered, in
slow almost hesitating tones, and as if her thoughts
were elsewhere engaged.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, not command, Catharine," said the king;
"but we do not forget it is your patron saint's
day," he added, in tones that conveyed also a
strong intimation of his will; "and it is our
pleasure."
</p>

<p>
"And that is mine," said the queen, too well
content to hesitate longer.

CHAPTER XXIII.
<br><br>
"DID YOU NOT KNOW?" SHE SAID.
</h3>

<p>
Slowly the gatehouse clock tolled out the
hours succeeding Lawrence's departure.
Terrible and solemn ones they were
for Ruth, maintaining her solitary watch
beside the secret panel where the wounded man
lay, with eyes closed, and now breathing heavily,
now catching feeble gasping breaths, so feeble that
more than once Ruth thought life had left him.
</p>

<p>
She had done her best, poor Ruth, and like any
Lady Bountiful of treble her years, had got out
her little stock of salves and simples and old linen
rag, and gently and tenderly dressed the gaping
wound; but it was all of just as much and no
more use than the endeavours of the skilfullest
doctors would have been.
</p>

<p>
"I am past thy surgery, child," he said in feeble
but distinct tones, when towards two o'clock he
stirred a little and opened his eyes.  "The knife
did its work.  But give me a drink&mdash;ay, a cordial
if you have it in your store.  So," and he eagerly
drank the contents of the little cup which Ruth
filled from a flask upon the table, and shouldering
himself feebly on his right side, his eyes
wandered wistfully round the shadowy chamber
as if in search of something, and rested at
last on a little table of carved oak, bearing
materials for writing.  "Bring it here," he said.  "Yes,
that is well," he went on, as Ruth, marking his
wish, even before he had given it utterance,
brought the table beside the panel and set it close
within his reach.  "For I have a message to leave
behind me, and my hours are numbered.  My
minutes belike," and his eyes closed; but in a few
seconds he opened them again, and stretched out
a trembling hand.  "Quick!" he went on.  "Pen
and paper, dear child, as thou'rt a God-fearing
maiden, and hop'st for heaven at last."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The dying man.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"As you do," gently murmured Ruth, spreading
the paper as well as she could out upon the
narrow bed, and placing the pen in his hand.  "As
you do, dear Master Goodenough."
</p>

<p>
"Nay," moaned the dying man.  "Sin lies
heavy on my soul."
</p>

<p>
"But God is love, dear Master Goodenough," said
Ruth, dashing aside the tears that blurred her sight.
</p>

<p>
"Who taught thee thy creed?" said the sheriff,
wonderingly fixing his hollow eyes on her pitying
face.  "'Tis none of the master's of this house,
for his is a gospel of wrath, and of vengeance for
our ill deeds."
</p>

<p>
"'I will have mercy and not sacrifice.'  Does
not the Bible say that, Master Goodenough? and
the Lord Christ, did not He say 'There is joy in
heaven over one sinner that repenteth.'"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A last message.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"I doubt," murmured the wounded man, "had
I been thy pupil, I had not been in this plight
now."  Then he gazed down at the blank paper,
and thoughtfully setting the pen to it, while
Ruth knelt upon the floor beside him and held
the lamp close, began to write.  "'<i>I Thomas
Goodenough, being now at the point of death</i>'&mdash;Thy
lamp burns very dim, there is a mist about
it," he went on, labouring at his self-imposed task,
while Ruth trimmed the flame, and made it shine
brightly enough, but it remained only a poor dim
thing enough for the eyes that never on this
world's sea or shore, would see the light
again&mdash;"'<i>by the hand of the man, Richard Rumsey, who
has thus now destroyed my body, as first he did
my soul&mdash;</i>'
</p>

<p>
"As first he strove to do that," amended Ruth,
watching the words, as one by one the labouring
tremulous fingers produced them.
</p>

<p>
"Take you the pen, and alter it then if you can
write, for my hand will not reach to't," said
Goodenough, "and may it be as you say, little
one," he went on, a gleam of something like
content breaking upon his pallid lips as Ruth took
the pen, and neatly wrote in her little amendment
between the crooked-back up-hill-and-down-dale
lines.  "'<i>As first he strove to ruin my soul, by&mdash;</i>'
Nay, but write on, and I will sign&mdash;quick&mdash;'<i>by
fair and reasonable seeming words; persuading
me to enrol myself into the foul plot which hath
been hatched for the making away of the persons
of His Majesty, and of His Majesty's Brother,
James, Duke of York; thereby</i>.'  Hast thou it
all down? '<i>thereby</i>,'" continued Goodenough, as
Ruth nodded, "'<i>to rid the country of the race of
Stuarts; and to set up rulers of their own
choosing</i>.'"
</p>

<p>
"Choosing," said Ruth as she wrote the last word.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A tale of murder.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"'<i>It now appeareth</i>,' went on Goodenough after
a brief silence, '<i>by this night's work, that there
has further been intended the compassing of the
murder of the king, and of his brother, by these
bloody-minded men</i>'&mdash;write on, child, quick,
quick!"  Ruth's hand trembled cruelly, and a huge
drop of ink fell from her pen; but she wrote on:
"'<i>by their waylaying of the coach in which the
king shall return from Newmarket;</i>' where's the
cup, child? give me another drink.  Now, thy
pen again&mdash;stay, my brain grows confused&mdash;ay,
from Newmarket, '<i>upon the by-road which runs
by the Rye House, over against Hoddesdon, and
there stopping the coach by the overturning of a
cart across the narrow way, to shoot the guards
from the hedges, and so in cold blood to kill the
king and his brother</i>.'  Hast thou that all down
in black and white?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Ruth, though in sober truth
the characters glared fiery red from the fair white
paper in her fevered eyes.
</p>

<p>
"'<i>And hereby</i>,' faltered on the dying man, '<i>I,
with these my last perishing breaths do declare,
that of the forty conspirers in this plot, I take
not upon myself to single out the more guilty,
and murderously disposed ones; save only that
my own soul is innocent of all desire and intent
to shed blood; and furthermore I do desire to
state, that of those plotters who gathered this
night to discuss the ways and means for His
Majesty's death, the young man Lawrence&mdash;</i>'"
</p>

<p>
"Lee; yes, yes, Lawrence Lee," rapidly wrote
on Ruth.  "I know, Master Goodenough."
</p>

<p>
"Thou dost? so much the better, the brave lad
who would&mdash;who would&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, who would have saved you from that
fearful man if he could."
</p>

<p>
Goodenough nodded.  "<i>Lawrence Lee was not
one</i>,' and&mdash;and&mdash;"  Goodenough's voice sank to a
whisper, and his dim eyes closed.  "I can say no
more.  I would have&mdash;liked to&mdash;tell&mdash;the noble
turn he did me&mdash;and&mdash;how&mdash;thou, whoever thou
art&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The light grows dim.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Slower and slower, fainter and fainter, rose
and fell the dying man's voice upon the silence;
until suddenly his eyes opened, and fixing
wistfully for a little while upon Ruth's face,
wandered from it to the paper under her hand.
"Set thy name to it," he said, "for&mdash;a living witness."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis well," he went on, when she had obeyed.
"And now, give it me here again under my hand,
and thy pen&mdash;and hold the light close, for it
grows so dark&mdash;dark&mdash;nay, but I cannot see the
place;" and his fast glazing eyes strayed helplessly
over the paper.
</p>

<p>
"Here, dear Master Goodenough," said Ruth,
taking the cold hand and gently placing it aright,
"here is where I have written my name."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The signatures.
</span>
</p>

<p>
He made a desperate but ineffectual effort to
steady the pen on the spot she indicated.  "I
cannot do it," he said, as the quill dropped loosely
in his numbed fingers; "and my mark must
suffice.  But 'twill serve&mdash;'twill serve.  Set the
paper close&mdash;closer;" and then with infinite labour
he made the cross mark.  "Ruth Rumbold!" he
cried, as he moved his hand, and the full light of
the lamp fell upon the clear, boldly-marked
characters of her signature beneath.  "This
man&mdash;Richard Rumbold's&mdash;daughter!" and his eyes
fixed upon her in a stare of mingled horror and pity.
</p>

<p>
She nodded her head slowly up and down.
"Did you not know?" she said, meeting his gaze
with sad, appealing looks&mdash;"did you not know
he was my father?"
</p>

<p>
"Then Heaven help thee, poor child, and comfort
thee, for thou hast need of it indeed, poor
innocent!"
</p>

<p>
Then his voice fell away into uneasy inaudible
murmurings.  His eyes closed again, and presently
he seemed to sleep.  And so till dawn slowly began
to silver the fresh young leaves about the ivy
panes, and creep on into the room towards the dark
recess, spreading itself gently on the white, still
face of the dying man, and the hardly more life-like
one of the watcher, there was silence.  But
just as the song of the birds trilled cheerily forth,
he stirred slightly.  "Art thou there?" he
murmured, feebly stretching out his hand.
</p>

<p>
"I am here, dear Master Goodenough!" she
said, kneeling beside him and covering the pale
fingers in her gentle clasp.
</p>

<p>
"God bless thee, child!" and he drew her
hand close towards his lips: "for thy sweet charity
God bless&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Death of Goodenough.
</span>
</p>

<p>
And in a smile of content the lips parted
slightly, a low sigh broke from them, and Master
Goodenough was dead.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV.
<br><br>
LAWRENCE SLEEPS ON IT.
</h3>

<p>
"Now, Friend What-d'ye-call-'em, are
you going to accept his majesty's
polite invitation? or d'ye mean to
stand staring all day like a stuck
pig, at your brother-porker's pate here?"
</p>

<p>
The dig in the ribs accompanying these words,
which were rendered bewilderingly indistinct by
reason of the quantity of the toothsome edibles he
referred to, filling the speaker's mouth, materially
assisted Lee to catch something of their signification;
and he started from the reverie into which
he had fallen.  "Your majesty&mdash;" he began, looking
round with dazed, uneasy eyes, and staggering
forward a pace or two.
</p>

<p>
"Ha! ha! ha!  That's excellent!" broke out a
laughing chorus.  "Your majesty!  Hear the
fellow!  Are his wits clean gone?  I' faith, he looks
something like it!  Majesty forsooth!  There's
none of it here, friend; unless we're to be having
you for a change.  Come, Master Up-in-the-clouds,
out with you!  Was ever such insolence!
Out with you!  D'ye hear?"
</p>

<p>
It was the most doubtful question in the world
whether he did.  If so, it was, at all events,
without a spark of comprehending; and Lawrence Lee
continued to lie back, pale and more than half
senseless, in the king's chair, whither he had
staggered forward as he had uttered those last words,
and with a twist and a reel, sunk among its
crimson cushions.
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said another of the crowd of lackeys;
"leave him alone.  Let him bide a minute.  I
saw 'twas a comin' over him before the king had
done speakin' to him.  He went on gettin' whiter
and whiter.  Come, man, drink a drop o' this;"
and he took a tall ruby-red Venice goblet of wine
from the table and placed it to the young man's
lips.  "So; that's brave!" he went on in kindly
tones, as Lawrence drank a little of the wine and
roused up.  "Finish it, man, and have another
atop o't.  One leg o' mutton drives down another.
Oh! eh! but we don't take noes here.  Drink, I
tell 'ee;" and refilling the goblet, the well-meaning
fellow forced Lawrence to drain it again, in spite
of his efforts at resistance.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Where is the King?
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Where's the king?&mdash;the king?" said Lawrence
as consciousness all broke in upon him, and he sat
up.  "I must speak to him.  I haven't told him
half&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then t'must wait!" cried another lackey, "for
the king's gone."
</p>

<p>
"Gone!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay; ever so far by now.  He wasn't going to
stop here all day listening to your wild-goose
tales, I doubt.  He's half-way across the heath by
now, and all the lot after him."
</p>

<p>
"But the queen!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay; her too.  Didn't you see them all go?
Where had your eyes got to?"
</p>

<p>
"Gone a wool-gathering along of his wits!"
laughed another.
</p>

<p>
And while their shouts of boisterous laughter
made the old walls echo again, Lawrence pressed
the palms of his hands on the top of his aching
head and made an effort to recall all that had
passed, and to solve the puzzle of the strange
condition in which he found himself.  Possibly
the fact of neither food nor drink having passed
his lips since a hasty meal snatched at the Nether
Hall early dinner of the previous day, was
accountable for much of it.  Neither can long-fasting
men ride a score and a half of miles and retain
their wits in good working order; and strong
wine, if it be a temporary remedy, is scarcely one
to be recommended, as these noisy court lackeys
seemed bent on doing.  And when he refused the
dainty food they hospitably pressed upon him
with the savageness only those who have lost all
desire for eating, from too long going without it,
can ever be guilty of, they forced more wine upon
him, challenging him with a toast he neither
dared nor willed to refuse.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A loyal toast.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"The king! the king!" they cried, filling all
round for themselves, and brimming the goblet in
his hand.  "Come, Master Stranger, we must see
what metal you're made of.  Drink a bumper to
the king's majesty, and no heeltaps.  Here's
confusion to all crop-eared knaves."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay!" shouted Lee, starting to his feet, and
waving the goblet high over his head.  "Confusion
to all crop-eared knaves.  And now a toast.
A toast!"
</p>

<p>
"Silence!  Oh, yes; oh, yes!  Listen!" shrieked
the noisy crew.  "Fill high.  His majesty the
chairman proposes a toast."
</p>

<p>
"The queen.  God bless her!" cried Lee, putting
the glass to his lips and draining it to the
last drop.
</p>

<p>
"Ho! ho!  Ha! ha!  Queen?  Which queen?"
cried the roysterers.  "Which queen?&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Queen Ruth, to be sure!" shouted one, hooking
his arm into Lawrence's as Lee rose from the
chair.  "She of the Rye House, you blockheads.
Queen Ruth!"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Lawrence escapes.
</span>
</p>

<p>
The sound of her name steadied Lee's senses
like the working of a charm.  He straightened
himself to his full height, and striking out right
and left, sent the troublesome fellows stumbling
and tripping pell-mell among the chairs and
tables.  Then with a parting fling of his empty
glass at the one who had dared to make a jest of
the dear name, he rushed from the room&mdash;on,
on&mdash;by the now entirely deserted ante-chambers,
headlong down the grand staircase, through pitch
dark interminable passages, until he found himself
standing spent and breathless in the open air,
the cloudless blue sky above him, and his feet
ankle-deep in a miry lane.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The King's garden.
</span>
</p>

<p>
The place seemed to form a sort of thoroughfare
to the back premises of the palace, whose walls
skirted its length on one side, while the other
was bounded by a tall privet-hedge.  Between the
ragged twigs he could discern the broad flat stretch
of country beyond.  On the left, some fifty yards
off, stood the timbered plaster fronts of a row of
street cottages, and a few paces to his right a high
narrow iron gateway, flanked by a couple of moss-grown
stone pillars surmounted respectively by the
royal lion and unicorn.  Through this gate's
filigreed iron-work, at the end of a somewhat broad,
gravel, yew-bordered path, Lee could see a podgy
marble Cupid spouting water through a hunting-horn
into a basin.  Lured by the gentle plash of
the water, he approached the gate and attempted
to push it open.  With a faint screech, as if of
surprise at being disturbed, it yielded, and
undeterred by its stone guardians, whose jaws seemed
indeed to grin less in defiance of his intrusion,
than in wonder and derision at his fancy for
exploring the deserted place, Lee entered, and strolled
towards the fountain.  On its broad edge he
seated himself, to the great confusion of the gold
and silver fish moving about its weedy depths,
and found that it formed the centre of a fair-sized
garden, the path by which he had come being one
of four, radiating off at equal distances between
grass-plots, towards the lofty red brick boundary
walls, gay now with the snowy blossom of
espaliered fruit-trees.
</p>

<p>
Here and there white stone gods and goddesses
gleamed amidst the dark yew paths, and would
have seemed to render the silence of the place
still more intense, had it not been broken by the
voices of the myriad insect creatures footing it
merrily among the parterres, and the darting
butterflies, while stout old bumble-bees hummed
cogitatively as they gathered in their wealth, as
if they were mentally reckoning the probable
sum total of its returns; and all to the music of
Sir Cuckoo, who had a vast deal to promise of the
good time coming.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A reverie.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Well, well; and Lawrence Lee, rising from his
seat on the fountain's brink, and strolling listlessly
onward by the nearest path, heaved a prolonged
and heart-vexed sigh, making all the while not
too flattering comparisons between these careless
denizens of the king's pleasaunce&mdash;the bees, of
course, simply proving his case by their exceptional
prudence&mdash;who troubled their feather-brains
not one doit about to-morrow's storms, which were
as likely as not&mdash;more likely than not, indeed, to
fall; as you might see if you would but spare half
an eye towards the south-eastward horizon&mdash;and
the king himself.  As to the idiotic, selfish,
frivolous lot about him, they were beneath contempt,
Lawrence considered.  To compare them with the
butterflies and gnats would be an insult&mdash;to the
insects.
</p>

<p>
This stage of his meditations brought him so near
to the foot of a flight of rustic wooden steps that
he tripped upon the lowermost one; and looking
upward, as he recovered his balance, he saw that
they wound up to some height, terminating at
the entrance of a pavilion of octagon shape, built
into the angle of the wall, and partly overhanging
the road running beneath.  For sheer lack of
something better to wile away his enforced leisure&mdash;for
to see the king again, by hook or by crook, Lawrence
was determined&mdash;he ascended the steps,
and found himself in a small eight-sided chamber.
Its walls were studded with morsels of spar,
bright-coloured shells, and bits of looking-glass disposed
in various and eye-fatiguing geometrical devices,
sparkling like Hassan's cave in the rays of sun,
now beating fiercely through the two windows.
One of these looked upon the road, the other,
commanding a view of the rear of the palace,
admitted light into the place; but in accordance
with the rule of such pleasure-houses, no air,
since they were "not made to open."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The summer house.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, a cool breeze rustled in through
the doorless entrance; and Lawrence, wearied out,
and still dizzy with the fumes of the wine which
had been forced upon him, sank upon the part of
the bench running round the wall which was
nearest the inner window, and fell to a listless
contemplation of the scene before him.
</p>

<p>
Ugly, or altogether unpicturesque it assuredly
could not be called; but incongruous and disorderly
it was, with its queer irregular mass of wall and
roof, new and old, time stained and brand new, all
flung together without apparent rhyme or reason,
as if they might settle down as they could.
</p>

<p>
It was some time before Lawrence was able to
distinguish, amid such countless odd holes and
corners, the door by which he had found his way
into the open air; and longer still before, carrying
his eye to the upper story, he discovered the row
of little bull's-eye casements which lighted the
corridor conducting to the king's apartments.
That it ran to the rear of the palace he had some
hazy sort of notion; since through one of those
casements he had caught a glimpse of waving
green beechen boughs, and had guessed at the
possibility of a garden beyond, while not a single
tree shaded the street front of the palace.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A long nap.
</span>

<p>
The last straw, eastern wiseacres say, breaks
the camel's back; and it is possible that his toilsome
little ascent to the pavilion, and the burning
sunbeams pouring in through the glass on Lawrence's
head bore their share in producing the drowsy
sensations stealing so rapidly upon him, that all
the scene before him dissolved as he looked, into
one confusing haze.  "'Tis like a dream," he
murmured to himself, pressing the palms of both his
hands on his throbbing temples, in a desperate
effort to shake off their oppression.  "A murrain
on those rascals for drenching me with that stuff
till I feel as if I was spinning in an Epping Fair
merry-go-round.  Like a dream&mdash;a bad dream"&mdash;and
his head drooping lower and lower upon his
arms outspread upon the broad window-seat,
rested a dead weight there at last, and he fell
asleep.
</p>

<p>
Heavily as one of the Seven Sleepers he slept
on.  Ten, eleven, mid-day came and went; and
still, as afternoon lengthened, and the shadows
grew deep upon the grass, he stirred only to sink
back again into the unrefreshing sleep of utter
fatigue and exhaustion.  Sultry as midsummer
the sunbeams poured into the airless chamber, till
its walls seemed sheeted in parti-coloured flame,
which grew but the more dazzling as the time of
parting drew on, and the gray evening mists began
to spread over the low-lying fields.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A sudden waking.
</span>
</p>

<p>
High aloft in the greenish blue sky the young
May moon rose and mingled her mild beams
with the fiery westward glow, and still he slept
on; but restlessly now, and muttering hurried but
inarticulate words, as if he was dreaming
uneasy dreams.  How much longer he would have
drowsed the precious hours away, it is hard to
guess, had it not been for a sudden and deafening
blare of French horns and all kinds of music,
mingled with shouts of gay laughter and voices
which broke just beneath the window, sending Lee
to his feet with a start and a cry of terror.
"Fire!  Fire!" he shouted, staggering to the middle
of the floor and gazing in wild distraction round
the pavilion, while he gasped for breath in its
stifling atmosphere.  Could it be that he was
dreaming still?  Strange ugly visions of&mdash;Nay,
now, but see what things are dreams! and what
is it after all but the setting-sun blaze?  And as
Lee stumbled tremblingly back against the trellised
doorway, greedily drinking in the cool evening
air, his senses dawned upon him.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay," he said to himself, with a faint smile
of amusement at his own fancies, as he stretched
his neck over the wall, just in time to obtain a
glimpse of the brilliant cavalcade turning the street
corner in a cloud of white dust, and caught the
shouts of the little crowd collected to see the king
pass.  "Come back, has he?  Yes, yes, God save
him, with all my heart and soul&mdash;God save the
king!  But the question is, you see, good people.
The question is&mdash;" and then Lawrence Lee came
to a dead pause, and fell into a deep reverie.  "How
was he to be saved?" pondered on the young man,
his brows knitting painfully.  This happy-go-lucky
Charles, who suspected no foul play, because he
would persist in judging others by himself, despite
all his harsh experiences, and thought no one
capable of taking so much trouble as to contrive
it.  This good-natured gentleman, whose manner
of speaking, far more than the words he spoke,
had won Lawrence Lee's heart, as they were apt
to win all who approached him.  How&mdash;so the
young man now asked himself, could he ever have
been brought to nurse one traitorous thought
towards him?  Ay, now indeed he understood,
as never he had before, his mother's glowing look,
when with the proud tears glistening star-bright
in her eyes, she would say: "Thy father died for
his king, lad."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
What is to be done?
</span>
</p>

<p>
The last shout sank to silence.  The birds' song
ceased.  The last ray of the sunset glory faded,
and only the plash of the fountain broke the
silence, and still Lawrence Lee stood leaning
against the ivied wall so motionless, and his face
showing so white and fixed in the dazzling
moonlight, that he might have been taken for one of
the garden's statues; but at last, as eight o'clock
struck in the town belfries, and far-off village church
towers chimed it back, he stirred, and slowly
descended the little rustic steps.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A deep resolve.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Rest thee well, father," he murmured, reverently
folding his hands as he went.  "The world
may blame me, and say what it lists.  The king
shall be saved, though my life should answer for
it.  Father&mdash;only let heaven count me worthy to
be called thy son."
</p>

<p>
And so across the garden, and through the
gate, still standing half open as he had left it, he
passed on into the street.

CHAPTER XXV.
<br><br>
SUPPER AT THE SILVER LEOPARD.
</h3>

<p>
"Oh, all that I grant you; 'tis indeed a
mockery of hospitality which moves
a man to press his good things on
his guest beyond his appetite; and
the rascals were to blame&mdash;much to blame.  But,
my good Master Lee, you're absolutely no trencherman."
</p>

<p>
And as he spoke, Master Alworth laid a tempting
cut from the huge sirloin before him upon
Lawrence Lee's plate.  "A strapping fellow of
your inches," he went on, "should know better
how to dispose of a glass, and to ply his knife
and fork."
</p>

<p>
"Nay," answered Lee, toying with the implements
in question till he seemed to be making
grand havoc with the slice of beef.  "But I have
supped excellently," and he glanced in courteous
admiration at the temptingly loaded table.
"Such good things would almost charm a dead man."
</p>

<p>
"And 'tis almost what he looks," thought the
goldsmith, as he secretly scanned Lee's colourless
face; colourless save where on either cheek two
spots burned crimson red.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A good servant.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Though I doubt dead men's eyes never shone
like his," he mentally added.  "What the mischief
ails the lad?" but aloud he only replied in
well-pleased tones: "They're wholesome enough; and to
speak no treason, Master Lee, the king's own kitchen,
at least here in Newmarket, boasts not such
a hand as my old Margery's at turning a venison
pasty; try a morsel of it.  No? well then, drink, man,
drink.  There's no finer colouring for white cheeks
like your's, than a glass of my old Tokay.  What! you
won't neither?" said his hospitable host with
a shrug, as Lee drew the massive silver-gilt goblet
smilingly but resolutely on one side.  "I' faith!
I like not sots and topers," he went on, as he
filled his own glass to the brim, "and as worthy
Warwickshire Will&mdash;Oh, no offence, young
gentleman&mdash;out of date Master Shakspere may be, but
mind you, he can frame as wise and witty a phrase
when he pleases, as any of your Shadwells or
Rochesters, or your long-winded Master Drydens
either, and he says ''tis a shame for men to put an
enemy in their mouths, to steal away their
brains.'  But wine need be no man's enemy.  It should
rather be his trusty servant and helper.  For
wine, as another wise man hath it, is a good servant,
though it be a tyrant master, just as fire&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Fire!  Fire!" loudly echoed Lawrence, starting
from the brown study into which he had fallen
during his entertainer's disquisition.
</p>

<p>
"Why, bless the good fellow!" ejaculated the
goldsmith under his breath, as he leant back in
his well-cushioned chair, and tipping together the
points of his ten fingers, contemplated Lawrence
through his half-closed eyelids with no small
curiosity.  "'Tis but a cloud-brained lad after all;
one would ha' guessed I'd flashed a musket-shot
in his ear, to see him start."
</p>

<p>
"Ay," he added aloud, "I was but remarking
that fire is a good servant, but a bad master, since
'tis easier to kindle a flame than to put it out.
But come, tell me now.  How did your suit
prosper to-day with his majesty?  Though in
truth what its nature was I know not; nor desire
to be inquisitive," he added good-humouredly, as
he perceived that Lee showed little willingness
to enlighten him.  "But you succeeded in it?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;yes, no&mdash;that is, I saw the king."
</p>

<p>
"And spoke with him?"
</p>

<p>
"And spoke with him&mdash;Oh yes."
</p>

<p>
"And what think you of his majesty?" catechised
on his host, just a thought drowsily.  "A
right debonair and gracious gentleman, is he
not so?"
</p>

<p>
"Every inch a king," enthusiastically cried Lee.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Lawrence drinks another toast.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh ho! have I warmed the ice at last?"
thought the goldsmith, with a twinkle in his eyes.
"Why, so say I, Master Lawrence," he cordially
rejoined.  "And&mdash;come now, a challenge, you can't
refuse&mdash;nay, i' faith! but you must drain it.  I
shall hold you a double-dyed traitor else indeed.
Here's to King Charles," and reaching the
bottle over Lee's goblet, he filled it, unchecked
this time, and rose to his feet.  "God bless him,
and confusion to his foes by land and sea."
</p>

<p>
"Confusion to his foes!" echoed Lawrence,
rising too, and draining the cup to its dregs.
</p>

<p>
"And, since his majesty so well pleases you, what
think you of his Newmarket palace?" continued
Alworth, as both resumed their seats, manfully
struggling to keep up the lagging ball of conversation,
though, to own the truth, a long day over his
ledgers, the dulness of his companion, who did
not seem to be able to originate one single
observation, and the supper he had eaten, were
beginning to work more and more soporifically upon him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A rat-hole for a palace.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Palace!" cried Lee with sudden animation.
"A rat-hole; just a rat-hole.  Only fit to be
smoked out!"
</p>

<p>
"Scarce big enough, truly, to swing a cat in,"
laughingly acquiesced Alworth.  "'Tis a mean
place, as you say, with its chimneys huddled
away in corners and crannies, as if they were
ashamed of themselves; and the house abutting,
like any common one, upon the street, without
any court or avenue to't."[<a id="chap25fn1text"></a><a href="#chap25fn1">1</a>]

<p>
"I looked to find it built somewhere upon the
course itself," said Lee.
</p>

<p>
"As it should ha' been," replied the goldsmith.
"Upon the very carpet, as one might say, where
the sports are celebrated.  My own identical
words to Mr. Samuel, the&mdash;the gods forgive us!&mdash;the
architect.  'But,' says he, 'Master Alworth,
his majesty is bent on the purchase of this
wretched old house.'  And his majesty has a rare
obstinate head-piece of his own, like the one they
cut off his father's neck before him&mdash;heaven rest
his soul!  And so there's his fine house, and a
mighty improper one too, in my poor judgment,
for sport and pleasure, Mr. Samuel has made of it.
Though, to give even him his due, you may go
far before you find better turned arches than the
supports of the cellars that run beneath the king's
private apartments.
</p>

<p>
"Which lie to the back of the house, if I mistake
not," said Lee.
</p>

<p>
"You do not.  And cut off almost entirely from
the rest of it, a perfect network of pillars, and arches
beneath, that one might go losing one's self in, like
any trapped mouse, if you didn't know the trick of
them," added the goldsmith half absently, half as
if amused by some suggested thought, and toying
with an ancient-looking little twisted and chased
bar of silver which hung upon the massive gold
chain he wore round his neck.  "Tho' that would
scarcely be my case; for here I have an open
Sesame, that, if I had a mind to't, would bring
me straight into Hassan's Cave.  In other words&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Lawrence learns a secret.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"The king's own bed-chamber?" eagerly cried Lee.
</p>

<p>
"Why, you are quite right," said Alworth,
looking up with wide open astonished eyes.  Was
this young farmer such a dull-pated clodpole
after all?  "Though how you should guess&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I have heard of such contrivances as
these subterranean ways," said Lawrence
carelessly.  "Where does it lead from?"
</p>

<p>
"Under your nose almost!" laughed Alworth,
pointing to one of the large buttons, or bosses,
carved on the intersections of the oaken framework
of the wainscoting which lined the room.
</p>

<p>
"The dog's face?" asked Lee, carefully noting
his glance.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, 'tis a sphinx's.  And right well 'tis said
she has guarded her secret for the three hundred
years this house has been built."
</p>

<p>
"So long?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay.  Just about the same time that the
original foundations of what is now the king's
palace were set.  Some say that the lord of it,
and my grandfather six or seven times removed,
had dealings together in the black art,&mdash;but that
is a way folks have of talking of honest traders
when they happen to grow rich,&mdash;and that the
two would meet together alone in the vaults at
dead of night over their crucibles, to find out the
secret of making gold."
</p>

<p>
"Was he of your craft, Master Alworth?"
asked Lawrence.
</p>

<p>
"Ay; and a skilful master of it he must have
been," said Alworth proudly, detaching the key
from its chain and handing it to Lawrence for his
inspection, "to have been able to cast such a
pretty thing as this."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The sphinx's throat.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"And the lock it fits to," said Lawrence, taking
the key and examining it curiously, "lies, you
say, in the sphinx's throat yonder?"
</p>

<p>
The goldsmith nodded.  "And the tale goes on
to say," he added, "as I tell you, that they who
push far enough along the passage, when they get
to the bottom of the little staircase the panel
opens upon, would find themselves in the room
that is now the king's own bed-chamber.  But I'd
not care to be making the quest."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The key.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"I' faith! 'tis possible, for one thing, his majesty
might not care for the intrusion," laughed Alworth;
"and for a greater reason, I've no fancy to be
breaking my shins over broken-backed old stone
floors and slimy steps, or running my head against
these fine new stone posts of Master Samuel's, let
them be never so mighty well turned.  No; thank
you for nothing!" continued Alworth with a sapient
shake of his grizzled periwig.  "I'm quite content
to be in possession of the secret without putting
my knowledge to the proof.  And hark you, young
gentleman," he went on more gravely, "if I've
confided it to you, 'tis because&mdash;.  Eh! eh! somehow
I tripped upon it; but 'tis safe enough with you.
You're not a man to betray secrets.  You'll not
put your knowledge to any ill use," he went on,
as Lawrence made no reply, but bent his head
lower and lower over the key.  "'Twill go in at one
ear and out at t'other, eh?  By your leave," he went
on, stretching out his hand for the key, which,
however, Lawrence seemed in no hurry to give
back, but sat dangling it in his fingers, lost,
apparently, in deep thought.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, ha!  I see how it is," laughed the
goldsmith; "you'd be for reading my sphinx's riddle,
Master Harum-Scarum Christopher Columbus.
But I'll have none o' that.  Come, no tricks.
Give it back.  No tricks," continued Alworth, as
Lawrence obeyed and gave up the precious key.
"So, lie you there safe and snug," he went on,
slipping the key on to the chain again, and putting
it neatly into the breast of his coat,&mdash;"safe
and snug, little friend.  And as for you, Master
Lee, if you'll take my advice you'll be getting
between the sheets Marjory has spread for you in
the Blue Room above stairs."
</p>

<p>
"Many thanks," replied Lawrence, shaking his
head; "but that is not possible.  I should be back
at Nether Hall before mid-day to-morrow; and 'tis
a longish journey.  In an hour's time I ought to
be upon the road."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Nature's soft nurse.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Tut, tut, man.  Bed is the place for you
to-night, and not a horse's saddle.  Already your
eyes shine like candles kindled at both ends.
Six-and-thirty-hours it is, by your own showing, since
you've closed 'em; and you know what Will of
Warwick&mdash;and he speaks sound sense, mind you,
does Will&mdash;of Warwick; as good as any of your
modish Sedleys, and Shadwells, and&mdash;and&mdash;'sleep,
sleep, Nature's'&mdash;how does it go?  Why, to be
sure&mdash;'Nature's soft&mdash;nurse.'  Come, Master Lee, how goes
it?  You should know.  By my faith, but you should.
Ay&mdash;so it runs&mdash;'How have I frighted thee.'  Marry,
come up!  What's next?  'That thou&mdash;no more
shouldst weigh mine eyelids down'&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But then, like a wise physician who puts faith
in his own prescription, Master Alworth's senses
sank steeped in forgetfulness, his head drooped
gently among the cushions, and a profound snore
fell upon the silence.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence's face grew dark with vexation.  Could
anything be more tiresome and inopportune?  The
church clock struck eleven.  A fearfully late hour
for those good old times, when "early to bed, and
early to rise" made everybody "so healthy, and
wealthy, and wise."
</p>

<p>
"Master Alworth," said Lee gently, though he
was biting his lip all the while with impatience.
"Master Alworth, by your leave&mdash;I will bid you
good-night."
</p>

<p>
A second and deeper snore was the response.
</p>

<p>
"And farewell," shouted Lee.
</p>

<p>
"Eyelids down; eyelids&mdash;down," murmured
the sleeper.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
How to save the King?
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Nay, but begone I must," muttered Lawrence,
starting up and pushing back his chair, while his
eyes despairingly contemplated his slumbering
host, until suddenly a light flashed into them.
"Let's see what a shake will do," he went on to
himself, approaching Alworth's chair, and suiting
his action to his words with no gentle hand.
It produced no effect beyond an angry snort of
remonstrance from the sleeper, who turned in his
chair only to settle more comfortably.  "What is
to be done?" ejaculated Lawrence, casting desperate
glances towards the door, as if he intended
making a run for it.  "Another half hour&mdash;a
quarter, even, and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Something which fell with a faint jingle and a
clash to the floor at his feet, interrupted his
speculations.  He stooped to pick it up.
</p>

<p>
It was Master Alworth's gold chain, whose
elaborate fastening had apparently missed touching
home in his drowsy attempts to clasp it.
</p>

<p>
"Adieu, then," he said, placing the chain noiselessly
beside his host's plate, and wafting him a
kiss from his finger-tips; "for I must be taking
French leave, if you will not be having an English
one," and he turned to escape noiselessly from
the room.
</p>

<p>
The first step he took, however, brought his foot
down upon some small hard object.  He picked
it up.  It was the key, which must have slipped
from the goldsmith's chain when it glided from
his neck to the cushions of the chair, and thence,
as he had turned himself about, to the floor.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mad fancies
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, ho!" laughed Lee, looking at the key as it
lay in the palm of his hand; "you're a mighty
slippery little customer!" and he was about to
lay it with the chain, when he gave a start, and
stood stock still, as if some sudden idea had
mastered him; and still holding the key, he gazed
from it towards the sphinx with thoughtful
speculative eyes.  Could it be that she was
winking her heavy lids?  Were her grim lips curving
into a meaning smile until her very jaws seemed
to be opening? or was it all only the shadowy
flicker of the dying lamp? or perhaps a mere
delusion of the young man's already highly excited
brain.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence knew only that the half-mocking,
half-goodnatured face beckoned him irresistibly.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The false panel.
</span>
</p>

<p>
One instant he stood hesitating.  The next, he
had seized the lamp, and with the key in his hand
was on his knees before the panel.

CHAPTER XXVI.
<br><br>
"FIRE!  FIRE!"
</h3>

<p>
Silent and dark as any city of the dead
lies Newmarket under the starless sky.
Not so much as a glimmer to be seen
even about the palace, excepting from
the mullioned lattices of the king's own
bedchamber.
</p>

<p>
Two hours since, Charles bade good-night to his
courtiers, who, despite their best efforts to be
entertaining, were yawning frightfully after their
long day's pleasure; and then, retiring to his
dressing-room, he dismissed also his drowsy valets,
who, evidently for once in a way, seemed not
indisposed to allow him to draw on his own night-cap
instead of doing it for him, "for all the world," as
he used to complain, as if he were "some poor
Tyburn gallows-wretch."
</p>

<p>
Whether he was too tired for sleep, which is
sometimes the case with people, or not tired
enough, it was certain the king himself was in no
mood for sleep; and wrapping his silken dressing-gown
about him, and trimming the wick of the
massive silver lamp upon the table with his own
august fingers, he drew it towards him, and stretching
himself upon a couch, took up a book which
lay tumbled face downwards among its cushions.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Charles sits up to read.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"A fair outside truly," he murmured half aloud
to himself as he carelessly scanned its richly
emblazoned velvet and gilt binding, and then
proceeded as carelessly to turn its embossed pages;
"and with such a mighty pretty dedication to my
sacred majesty, that my poor privy-purse will
suffer cruelly, I fear.  Tho' I'll dare swear that 'tis
all as full of emptiness, or at best of fulsome fawning
flatteries, as my fine lords and ladies, who hang
upon my skirts, and care no more for me than this
little Médor here," and he gently caressed the
satin soft ears of the little dog who had jumped
to its favourite spot between himself and the
downy cushions, "who loves me&mdash;for the cake
and comfits I carry in my pocket.  Nay, but I do
thee an ill compliment after all, Médor; for though
to be sure thou mightst not be at the pains to
stretch out one of thy fringy paws here to help
me in my need, at least thou'dst not turn against
me, as some I wot of would, who have fed upon
my bounty.  But what have we here?" continued
the king, turning on again at the pages of his
book.  "Nay, now, fie, fie, Master Poetaster! but
is not your choice of mottoes here uncourtly,
to say the least?

more than the rest of the herd, were I to die
to-night, so long as your dedication money were
safe to you.  All&mdash;all alike, every man jack, and
woman jill of you.  'The king is dead,' you'd cry,
'alack! alack!' though I doubt your breath might
not reach to so much as that&mdash;'The king is

A startling visitor.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"God save the king!"

<p>
"Who goes there?" cried the king, starting to
his feet and flinging down the book.  What voice
was this, snatching, as it were from his lips the
very words that were upon them, and in tones so
deep and significant, from the darkest recesses of
the dimly lighted chamber?  "Who goes there?"
he reiterated, peering hard into the obscurity, till
at last his keen gaze caught the outlines of a
figure enveloped in a black riding cloak.
</p>

<p>
"A friend," answered the voice in hurried tones.
</p>

<p>
Charles laughed bitterly.  "Our foes in disguise
call themselves that," he said.  "Come
forward&mdash;friend, into the lamplight here."
</p>

<p>
The intruder needed not to do so much in
order to reveal his identity; for the words had
not left the king's lips before a glare of light lit
up the whole apartment, and revealed the face of
Lawrence Lee.  An exclamation of anger broke
from Charles; and he darted a look of mingled
suspicion and defiance on Lee.
</p>

<p>
"Ha!  I thought as much, Master Talebearer,"
he cried; "and this is your vaunted loyalty&mdash;this
is&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Fire! fire! your majesty," and Lee rushed
forward with outspread arms.  "Come quick! for
God's sake, come! afterwards hang me&mdash;kill me&mdash;do
as you will.  But now&mdash;now&mdash;the palace is
on fire, I say! and there's not an instant to lose."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Madness indeed.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Fire?" cried the king, casting a rapid glance
upward at the dazzling glare lighting up every
object in the room, and hurrying towards the
curtained entrance, only to stagger backward into
Lee's arms, overcome with the smoke and flame
bursting from the heavy drapery as he lifted it.
</p>

<p>
"No, no! great heavens! not that way!" shouted
Lee.  "Already the corridors have caught, and
communication will be cut off.  Come for your life;"
and he dragged the half-breathless king across
the room.  "Here, by the private staircase!"
</p>

<p>
"What private staircase?" demanded Charles,
reeling forward after Lee, with his hand to his
month.  "I tell thee, man," he went on, in tones of
anger as well as of fear, "there is no private stair&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Come! come!" shouted his deliverer with a
laugh of triumph which rang through the burning
room, and he seized the king round the waist
with both arms; "we are safe enough this
way&mdash;as yet."
</p>

<p>
"The dog! the dog!" cried the king, struggling
in Lee's embrace, and pointing towards poor
Médor, whose piteous yelpings resounded from
the couch.
</p>

<br>
LAWRENCE LEE SAVES THE KING
</p>

<p>
"Ay, come, then," said Lawrence, turning, and
catching up the little animal with one hand, he
thrust it into his pocket.  Then tightening his
clutch upon the king, he dragged him to a
square hole in the side of the wainscoted wall as
yet untouched by the flames, and almost flung
him down on his knees as with a vigorous push
he thrust him through the aperture.
</p>

<p>
"What is the meaning of this, sirrah?" angrily
demanded the king, as, after a maddening interval
passed in stumbling and sliding through pitch
darkness encircled by Lee's arms, he went round
and round, down and down, as if in some hideous
nightmare dream, till at last his feet were safely
deposited on level ground, and his shoulders
against a rough stone wall, which struck ice cold
through his silken dressing-gown.  "Say! what
does it all mean?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Fire on the brain.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Fire! fire! your majesty," was all Lawrence
could find breath to articulate, as, reeling from the
weight of his burden, he advanced towards a lamp
whose rays sufficed dimly to reveal a low stone
vaulted roof, supported by thick pillars, whose
outlines loomed ghost-like through the obscurity.
"The palace is on fire;" and catching up the
lamp, and again seizing the king, this time,
however, only by the arm and with a more gentle grip,
he succeeded in dragging him a few paces farther.
</p>

<p>
"This way! this way&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No," said the king, wrenching himself free,
and coming to a dead standstill with his back
resolutely planted against the wall!  "I'll go no
farther; not a yard.  'Tis some plot," he added,
casting suspicious looks round from Lee's face to
the darkness visible, and then again to the eager
agitated countenance of the young man.  "Some
scurvy plot.  Villain!" he cried, suddenly seizing
Lawrence by the throat.  "How many are there
of you?  Speak!"
</p>

<p>
It was only by something like a miracle, however,
that Lee was still able to breathe.  "Speak!"
shouted the king, and his imperious tones echoed
again and again through the vaulted place, till for
the moment he might well have fancied that a
host of conspirators were hidden away behind the
pillared arches; but not a creature came to the
rescue, and Charles's grip relaxed.  "I cry your
pardon," he said then, a little shamefacedly, and
retaining his hold about Lee's shoulder more in
kindness now than in anger.  "Such doubts are
unworthy.  A miserable requital indeed for this
good service you have shown me.  Your face
should be no traitor's.  Nay, never blush.  I
thought this morning that 'twas as honest a one
as I had seen for many a day, and should tell its
own story."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A desperate plan.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Yet even though my tongue helped it, your
Majesty would not listen.  Yet here as we stand,"
went on Lee, as Charles replied only by a shrug
of his shoulders, "man to man, liege-man to his
lord," and Lawrence fell on his knees at the king's
feet, "I swear I spoke the truth.  But it was to
worse than deaf ears.  All in vain&mdash;and so&mdash;and
so&mdash;" his voice faltered.
</p>

<p>
"And so&mdash;Ods-fish, man!" cried Charles in
bewildered astonishment at the agitation of Lee's
face.  "Don't be afraid.  Speak out.  And so?"
</p>

<p>
"I fired the palace."
</p>

<p>
"You!" cried the king, recoiling in horror.
</p>

<p>
"What else was to be done?" asked Lee, regaining
his composure, and shrugging his shoulders in
his turn!  "We smoke out the fox's hole when we
can't unearth him."
</p>

<p>
"To kill him after all, poor fellow," said the
king, with a half smile, and a faint glimmer of
the old suspicion in his dark eyes fixed on
Lawrence, as though he was striving to penetrate to
his inmost heart.
</p>

<p>
"Nay," bluntly answered the young man, "I
have no wit for carrying on conceits of that kind,
nor time for it neither.  If I burnt out the fox,
'twas to save him from himself, and get him to
make off out of harm's way."
</p>

<p>
"And what of the queen, and all my poor
people?" cried the king, looking with troubled
eyes along the way they had come.  "A heavy
ransom they are paying for my rescue.  Let us
get out of this place, and help, before every one of
them is burned in bed."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Out of danger.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"'Tis but little enough harm they'll come to,
I'll warrant," said Lee, in cool tones, and
detaining the king with a firm hand.  "The fire had
a mighty pretty effect," he continued, with
pride, "a mighty pretty effect; and so do a
man's frills and furbelows, though he hasn't a
thread of shirt underneath to bless himself with;
and 'twas just that and no more&mdash;a flash in the
pan, a snap-dragon, that has but just burned up
all your Majesty's little favourite odds and ends,
and rattle-traps, but I doubt it had not done a
groat's worth of harm."
</p>

<p>
"That's reassuring," said the king dismally.
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty may take my word for it,"
continued Lawrence.  "I did but fire the wainscot
of your chamber, as close as I could by the stone
corridor, which I know cuts off all communication
with the rest of the palace."
</p>

<p>
"But how did you know that?"
</p>

<p>
"One may learn a great deal&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"By opening one's mouth, hey, and asking questions?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Lawrence dictates to the King.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"By keeping it shut, and listening," said
Lawrence.  "Your Majesty may trust me for minding
what I was about, and that I risked no chance
against that sweet lady's life, just for the sake of
saving your Majesty's."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well," said Charles, feeling more and more
satisfied that he might place confidence in his
deliverer.  "But I like not these extremes," he
went on, shivering and dragging his thin Indian
silk garment about him.  "First, you frizzle me
within an inch of my life, and then you freeze me
to the marrow.  How long is it your pleasure
that we stop in this dreary cellar?"
</p>

<p>
"So please your Majesty's own pleasure, you
might be sleeping in your own bed-chamber at
Whitehall by this time to-morrow night?  'Twould
be the best course I can advise."
</p>

<p>
"I might do worse, I doubt," shivered the king.
</p>

<p>
"But you must leave Newmarket unattended
and secretly.  My horse stands at your Majesty's
service."
</p>

<p>
"And a pretty figure I should cut upon him!"
ruefully laughed the king, looking down at his
airy attire.  "To say nothing of my singed
periwig here," and he passed his hand over the spot
where the coal-black locks had been scorched and
burnt.
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty would in any case be safer for
finding one of another colour to travel in; and if
you'll but keep moving, I'll warrant that Master
Alworth will help you to it, and all else you may
need."
</p>

<p>
"Alworth!  Richard Alworth!" cried Charles.
</p>

<p>
"Ay," said Lawrence.  "Your Majesty, I take
it, can trust him."
</p>

<p>
"With untold gold," warmly said the king&mdash;"with
my crown jewels&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"With yourself, then."
</p>

<p>
"Have with you, Master Lee;" and the last
lingering doubt faded from his face.  "Which way?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">

<p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII.
<br><br>
"IN THE NIGHT ALL CATS ARE GRAY."
</h3>

<p>
The after-supper nap indulged in by
Master Alworth was no little affair of
forty winks; and he would possibly have
slept on till morning's light, had not
the sound of countless tramping feet, and a
deafening uproar of voices outside in the street,
disturbed his repose.
</p>

<p>
"Hey day! morning already!" he grumbled,
sitting up shiveringly, and cramped in every limb.
"Ha! what's that?" he went on, blinking and
rubbing his eyes, as a flare of red light broke
across the green-tinted traceried lattice of the
window looking into the High Street, and lit up
the room clear as day.  The next moment he was
in utter darkness, for the lamp had disappeared.
"Mercy alive, 'tmust be fire!" ejaculated the
goldsmith, as another and another flash rose and fell;
and aided by the fitful light, he groped, stumbling
among the chairs to the window-seat, where he sank
down staring horror-stricken at the showering
sparks, as they fell on the heads of the crowd
surging in the street, as far as his eyes could
reach.  "What, where is it?" he gasped, dashing
open a pane, and seizing the nearest gaper by the
chin.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Quick work.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"The king's private apartments, so 'tis said,"
answered the man, shaking himself free, and
rushing onward with the rest.  "And the king! the
king!" shrieked Alworth, in a frenzy of dismay
as he turned from the window, and groping forward
in the direction of the door, stumbled into
a pair of strong supporting arms.
</p>

<p>
"Here, Master Alworth, safe and sound," said
the unmistakable sonorous tones of Charles, as he
set the trembling old man on his feet again.
"Thanks to my young friend here."
</p>

<p>
"But how&mdash;how&mdash;" began Alworth, gasping
like a stranded fish.
</p>

<p>
"The sphinx helped me, Master Alworth," said
Lee, as he lighted a couple of waxen tapers which
stood on the buffet, by the flame of the almost
spent lamp.  "But we'll talk about all that
another time.  Meanwhile there's a plot being
hatched against the king's life; and if he stays
here till folks from the palace yonder find him,
and he be detained, and no doubt they are already
in search of him, 'tis likely to go hard but his life
runs in danger."
</p>

<p>
"What's to be done?" cried Alworth, gazing
with scared eyes from Lee to the king.  "What
is to be done?" he went on, wringing his hands.
"What can I do?"
</p>

<p>
"Lend him your coat, and the rest of it, and
your hat, and spare him your periwig&mdash;Eh?"
added Lee, laying despoiling hands on the grizzled
article in question.  "So, by your leave, 'in the
night all cats are gray.'"
</p>

<p>
"I would give my skin to save your Majesty,"
murmured the goldsmith, as he watched Lee tear
off Charles's singed perruque, and assist him in
fitting on the more venerable borrowed locks.
</p>

<p>
"Nay," laughed the king, "'tis not a flaying
question, I trust, though it comes pretty near it, to
be sure," he added, with a compassionate glance at
Alworth's coatless bald-pated figure.  "Here,
Master Alworth, take this for pity's sake.
Exchange is no robbery;" and tearing off his
gorgeous robe de chambre, he flung it across the
shoulders of Alworth, who, as he proudly drew
the garment about him, produced an effect less
beautiful than striking, and as much as possible
like some Chinese idol with his smooth shining
crown adorned by its tight little wisp of hair.
"Your Majesty," he said, as Lee put his finishing
touches to the king's rapid toilette, "looks
charming&mdash;perfection!" he went on, clasping his hands.
"The very double of myself.  No one would ever
take you for the&mdash;h'm&mdash;the sort of person you
are."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Ready for the road.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"I look like a better man, I doubt," answered
the king, turning to survey himself in a mirror.
"And now, Master Lee, what next?"
</p>

<p>
"Stars and Garters," said Lee.
</p>

<p>
"Ods-fish, man!" cried Charles, opening his
eyes.  "Hadn't we best be leaving those alone?
They'd be telling tales."
</p>

<p>
"Stars and Garters is the name of my mare,"
smiled Lee, "who is to carry your Majesty."
</p>

<p>
"To London?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, not so far as that, only to the King's
Arms by Hoddesdon Rye."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Into the lion's mouth.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"What?" cried Charles, with a little start of
surprise.  "Into the lion's mouth?"
</p>

<p>
"And the unicorn's.  Your Majesty will find no
loyaler hearts than beat there, where danger most
threatens you."
</p>

<p>
"I could get to London by another road;
'twould be better, even if it were ever such a
circuitous one," said the king dubiously.
</p>

<p>
"'Twould be safer to take the road I propose,"
said Lee, "since it is the one by which I must
return home; and I must have further speech with
your Majesty."
</p>

<p>
"Is your horse a good one?"
</p>

<p>
"Her better is not to be found in your Majesty's
stables.  She'll prove worth the cost of her
feed.  I'll warrant your Majesty will be telling
me that, when next we meet."
</p>

<p>
"At the King's Arms?"
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow afternoon; and there are those who
will not be far behind your Majesty on the road."
</p>

<p>
And then Lee, kneeling at the king's feet, took
his hand, and, kissing it, turned to go.
</p>

<p>
"Wait a bit," said Charles, detaining him;
"what&mdash;who the mischief am I?"
</p>

<p>
"For the next eighteen hours you cannot be a
better person than Master Alworth, called on
sudden pressing business affairs to London."
</p>

<p>
"That's all very well," said the king, still rather
perplexedly; "but I don't clearly comprehend&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then your Majesty must pardon me for saying
you are not Master Alworth."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Masquerading.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Well, well," laughed Charles, "'tis not the
first time Charles Stuart has been driven to
exercise his wits."
</p>

<p>
"And Stars and Garters," continued Lee, "will
serve the King of England at his need every whit
as well as ever Royal Oak did.  In ten minutes she
will be at the street corner."
</p>

<p>
And bidding a warm adieu to the goldsmith,
Lawrence Lee hurried away.

CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br><br>
FATHER AND DAUGHTER.
</h3>

<p>
And so as the shadows fled away, and
breaking day cast its pale gleams across
the face of the dead conspirator, Ruth
drew the panel back into its place;
for down in the malting-yard she could hear the
voices of the men getting to their work, and she
turned away, making an effort to collect her
thoughts.
</p>

<p>
It was no easy task; and she was still far from
having achieved it when she was roused by the
apparition of Maudlin Sweetapple's head through
the tapestry.
</p>

<p>
"Marry come up!  Dressed a'ready!" cried the
old woman grumblingly.  "We shall be havin'
thee astir in the middle o' the night next!  That
comes o' the maaster sendin' o' thee off to bed at
sundown, like he's bin so fond o' doin' o' late.
Oh, ay! they may say what pleases 'em," continued
Maudlin, searchingly scanning Ruth's face in the
young yellow sunshine; "but I say it don't agree
with thee, child.  Thy cheeks are as white as
turnips; an' thy face as gastered as if thou'dst bin
seein' of spirits.  And&mdash;for the gracious power's
sake!" she shrieked in terror as a rattling at the
locks of the opposite door suddenly made itself
audible, "what's that?  Master Rumbold, as I'm
a livin' soul!  And me&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Rumbold home again.
</span>
</p>

<p>
The rest was lost in the privacy of her own
apartment, into which Maudlin speedily withdrew
her benightcapped head.
</p>

<p>
"I may come in, Ruth?" said the maltster, as
he pushed open the door, and paused for an
instant on its threshold for her reply, casting, as
he did so, one swift keen glance round the room.
"I was upon the drawbridge and saw you opening
the window.  Up and dressed earlier than
usual; is it not so?"
</p>

<p>
"Is it, father?" said Ruth mechanically.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, is it, is it," he rejoined in impatient tones.
"Have you and your pillow quarrelled, that you
are so soon astir?" he went on.  "Come, can you
not answer me?"
</p>

<p>
"I could not sleep, father," faltered she.
</p>

<p>
"And why not, mistress?" he demanded with
the uneasy twitch of his lips which sometimes
did duty with him for a smile.  "Were the rats
more troublesome than usual?  A plague on the
vermin for eating my malt till I shall be ruined;
and vexing thy rest."
</p>

<p>
But Ruth only shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"Why, what then?" he insisted.  "Was perhaps
the White Woman walking?  Ah! for shame,
child, on thy foolish fancies!"
</p>

<p>
"Alack! father, 'twas no fancy," answered she.
"It was no White Woman's spirit that haunted
yonder room last night; but the black one of an
evil, wicked-hearted man."
</p>

<p>
"Psha!" said Rumbold with an uneasy laugh.
"Let us have done with riddles.  I understand
you now.  You heard me and my boys&mdash;"  He
stopped with a confused, shamefaced smile.  "That
is what the foolish fellows, you know, love to call
themselves.  You heard, belike, I say, me and my
friends&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Friends, father!" reproachfully interrupted she.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
An anxious question.
</span>
</p>

<p>
A deep flush suffused Rumbold's face, but his
tones of assumed careless indifference changed.
"How now, mistress?" he demanded with sternly
knitted brows.  "Was it needful to be craving
your leave for them to pay a little visit to the
Warder's Room to&mdash;to inspect its pictures,
and&mdash;and&mdash;its old oak chest, and&mdash;and&mdash;what not?"
rather lamely concluded Rumbold, darting at the
same time a keen sideways glance at her.  "But
let me tell you, Ruth, I like not these would-be
prying ways of yours.  'Tis fortunate that these
walls"&mdash;and he glanced with infinite satisfaction
round the solid-looking wainscot&mdash;"were not
made in to-day's gimcrack fashion, for the
entertainment of every eaves-dropper who pleases to be
lending his idle ear to&mdash;to concerns that are too
high for him.  You did hear nothing?" he added
with ill-concealed anxiety after a moment's pause.
</p>

<p>
"Father&mdash;dearest, do you love me?" was all
her answer.  "In truth, do you love me?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay.  What a strange girl you are, Ruth!
I love you dearer than life, little one;" and he
drew her towards him, and laid her head down
gently on his breast.  "Far, far dearer than life.
But hark you," and then all the wistful tenderness
died out of his voice, "that says not that I love
your faults.  Among which I find this prying,
curious habit&mdash;that accursed inheritance of which
our poor unhappy mother Eve has bequeathed her
daughters so large a share of."
</p>

<p>
"But, father&mdash;dearest&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ay.  Then let me see thee thy father's
child.  Seek truth and righteousness as he has
always done; and put off,&mdash;as some one put off
certain mountebank pink petticoats we wot of&mdash;eh,
little Ruth?&mdash;the pride of life, and the lust of
the eye and the ear; for these are but part and
parcel all of things that lead to the soul's
destruction; feeding vain imagination and empty
fancy&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Father!  father!" interrupted Ruth, wildly,
"I would it were fancy, or that my poor silly
imagination were to blame.  But 'tis truth and
fact indeed.  See here!" and dragging him before
the panel, she pushed it open with hasty trembling
hands.  "See what these&mdash;friends of yours
have done!"
</p>

<p>
"Sheriff Goodenough!" cried Rumbold, recoiling
in horror-struck amazement!  "Dead?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Murdered!
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Murdered&mdash;look.  There is blood upon his hands."
</p>

<p>
"Who has done this?  Who?&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Rumsey."
</p>

<p>
"The villain!" muttered Rumbold, grinding his
teeth.  "I knew," he went on meditatively, knitting
his brows, "that their hearts were not at peace with
one another.  How came we to be so ill-advised
as to leave them alone together?&mdash;Yet to dream
of its coming to this!  And how&mdash;"  Then he
paused.  What need to ask how she had come by
her information?  The broken panel explained
all.  "What brought it about?" he said after
another silence.  "They came to high words?"
</p>

<p>
Ruth nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Concerning?&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The murder of the king."
</p>

<p>
"Master Goodenough being opposed to it?"
</p>

<p>
"And Master Rumsey," nodded Ruth, "all for
striking him down&mdash;unawares&mdash;like he has poor
Master Goodenough himself."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Honour among conspirators.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Ay," said Rumbold, "I guessed as much;
though he breathed no word of it.  I suspected
it, I say, to be in his thoughts.  Heaven forgive
him!  I think now, he would not have hesitated
at putting poison in&mdash;a man's food, be he Charles
Stuart, or any other&mdash;or stabbing him in his sleep,
so only that he might gain his end."
</p>

<p>
"But you, father, you?" almost joyfully cried
Ruth.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, we are not assassins.  I and my&mdash;friends.
And this scum of the earth, Richard Rumsey was
not fit to consort with men of honour like us&mdash;we
looked, Walcot and the rest of us, we looked
indeed to be the slayers, if heaven blessed our
project, or the slain, and it saw fit.  A fair fight,
front to front&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Fair!" cried Ruth, "Fair?  In that narrow
by-way?  Where the coach could not pass for the
overturned cart!"
</p>

<p>
Rumbold frowned.  "You have it all, seemingly,
at your fingers' ends, mistress," he said, "and
'tis useless to dissemble with you; or to reason
over nice and just distinctions with obstinate
young maids' brains.  Enough!  See only that you
make a discreet use of your indiscretion.  Keep
a silent tongue in your head.  Do you hear me,
mistress?  Or by&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Father! father! kill me.  Do with me what
you will," cried Ruth, throwing herself at his feet.
"By this time the king knows all!"
</p>

<p>
"Girl!" and in his fury he turned pale as the
dead man beside him, and seized her by both
wrists.  "How?  By what means?  Who?  This
is Lawrence Lee's handiwork?  Speak."
</p>

<p>
Her lips moved, but she made no answer.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The looming gallows.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Betrayed!" he wailed forth in a paroxysm of
impotent fury, "and brought to naught!  Destroyed
like any wind-bag.  All our holy work&mdash;our sacred
compact.  By the machinations of a frivolous
girl, and a love-sick Don Quixote of a boy!  Oh,
Ruth, Ruth!  Little Ruth, was he indeed more to
you than your father&mdash;and your very faith?  Ay,
but 'tis so&mdash;'tis so.  What have you done?  And is
it nothing to you neither, that this brave night's
work of your's must see me swing for it on Tyburn
tree?"
</p>

<p>
"Father! father!  No, no," shuddered Ruth.
"There is time&mdash;time yet to escape."
</p>

<p>
"Ho!  Is there so?" cried he with a grating
bitter laugh.  "I protest now, my daughter, you
are really too tender and dutiful.  Time is there?
Time for me to play the poltroon's part, and make
a byword and a scorn of myself while the world
lasts!  No, let them take me here.  And yet&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A father lost.
</span>
</p>

<p>
He paused, and his hold on Ruth's arms relaxed,
so that she slowly fell away from him, while he
stood sternly gazing into the chilly morning haze
as though he saw in it some prophetic vision.
"And yet," he murmured, "to be hunted down
so.  To let myself be trapped like vermin&mdash;when
still I may be preserved, for an instrument to
crush out the superstition and the tyranny of
these evil days that darken more and more&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Father! father!" implored Ruth.  "Quick!
By the vaults.  Before it is too late!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he went on, letting his keen glance drop
on her for a moment, and then fixing it again like
some prophetic seer, on empty space.  "So it shall
be.  And my voice shall yet once more be uplifted
to cry: Woe! woe! to the doers of wickedness in
high places.  Yes, I will live.  I will live!  I will
stoop, even to the very dust beneath my feet&mdash;to
conquer.  I will live&mdash;and if every hair of my
head were a man, I would venture them all in
this quarrel."
</p>

<p>
Then he turned, and looked towards the door.
</p>

<p>
"Father!" cried Ruth, dashing aside the tangle
of hair all fallen about her face, and clinging to him
with agonized clutch.  "Father! one kiss&mdash;one
word&mdash;one little word before you go!"  But his
face was turned stonily upon the door.
</p>

<p>
"Father!"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Alone!
</span>
</p>

<p>
Then he was gone, leaving her stretched where
at last he wrenched himself free of her clinging
agonized hands, prone and senseless upon the
threshold.

CHAPTER XXIX.
<br><br>
A WELCOME HOME.
</h3>

<p>
"Past three o' the clock, and a fine starlight
night," piped the old watchman, as
he shuffled along, bell and lantern in
hand, down Newmarket High Street.
"Past three o' the clock."
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!  Master Diogenes.  Have a care where
you're running to," cried a deep good-humoured
voice, as the old fellow came trundling full-tilt
against the tall, broad-shouldered figure of a man
dressed in gray, who was just about to vault on to
the back of a fine black horse standing before the
door of the Silver Leopard.  "Are you looking
for an honest man?"
</p>

<p>
"I've found him anyhow, Master Alworth,"
replied the old man, half lifting his lantern to the
face of the speaker, which was shaded by a hat of
gray felt, whose broad brim almost covered the
long iron-gray locks of his periwig.  "'Tis the
early bird that catches the worm, they say,"
continued he.  "But you be astir betimes indeed,
Master Alworth."
</p>

<p>
"I've a longish journey before me."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The watchman.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Cambridge?" asked the old fellow.
</p>

<p>
"Nay.  Farther by many a mile," answered
the other, vaulting into the saddle.
</p>

<p>
"The powers alive!  You don't say so!  Well,
you seem in mighty good trim for the task
anyhow!  'Tis many a month,&mdash;years not to
say&mdash;since I've noticed ye so springy-like about the
knees, Master Alworth."
</p>

<p>
"H'm," said the traveller, passing his hand
across the lower half of his face and then down his
thighs.  "But I must mind, or I shall be paying
for my agility."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay.  It don't do to be making too free
when us is gettin' well on in our threescore, do it?
But happen 'tis some good stroke o' business as is
greasin' the wheels for ye," slyly laughed the old
fellow.  "Coin's a rare mender of a man's paces.
'Tis money&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Makes the mare to go," laughed the horseman.
"Try the recipe yourself, friend," and he
threw a crown-piece upon the ground.
</p>

<p>
Not without a half-suppressed exclamation of
surprise at the goldsmith's unwonted liberality,
albeit Master Alworth was no skinflint, the old
man picked up the coin, and contemplated it
with affectionate admiration.  "I never see
likenesses of old Rowley ever pleases me so well as
these do," he said.  "Eh, Master Alworth?"
</p>

<p>
"They're well enough," said the horseman, with
a preoccupied shrug, as he stooped to adjust his
stirrup.
</p>

<p>
"Tho', to be sure," continued the old man, "I
grant you 'tis mightily handsomer than ever
Charles was, or is like to be.  For 'tis few on us
grows comelier as we gets on in the years.  And
there's no doubt this here picture makes the best
of him.  But there, 'tis part o' kings' trades to be
flattered, 'tan't oftentimes as they stumble upon
truth."
</p>

<p>
"Ods-fish!" laughed the other, "'tis seemingly
a deal more likely to stumble upon them!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay&mdash;Past three o' the clock! and a fine starlight
night&mdash;you may say that, for stumblin' 'tis, an
no mistake, when you get no heed nor thanks
neither for your pains.  Maybe as you've heard&mdash;for
the tale's in everybody's mouth by now&mdash;that
there came one yesterday mornin' to the king, to
warn him o' some fresh plottin's that's hatchin'.
And what does Charles do, but turn on his heel,
along with all his tag-rag an' bobtail o' lords an'
ladies, an' leave the young gentleman to take care
o' himself&mdash;Past three o' the clock, an' a starlight
night&mdash;what d'ye think o' that?"
</p>

<p>
"I think 'twas mightily ill-bred of him," said
the horseman.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
News.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Well, pray Heaven the breedin' be the baddest
part o't, and keep his majesty from any worse dangers
than this night's," said the old man fervently.
</p>

<p>
"The fire, do you mean?  But&mdash;'twas nothing
after all?"
</p>

<p>
"Just a flash in the pan.  An up-an'-ha'-done-wi't
piece of business.  Not so much, as far as I
can make out, as a hair o' the tails o' one o' his
little spannel dogs scorched."
</p>

<p>
"And the king?"
</p>

<p>
"He? oh ha!&mdash;near four o' the clock, an'&mdash;not to
be found high nor low, so 'tis said.  But what
won't folks say?  He knows where he is, depend
upon't; 'tis not the first time as Charles has bin
mislaid.  He'll show up again, safe as the nose
on your face.  A cat with nine lives is old
Rowley, God bless him!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, adieu, friend!"
</p>

<p>
"And a safe journey to your worship&mdash;Just
four o' the clock, an' a bright sunshiny morning,"
called out the old man, trudging on and ringing
his bell with such tremendous energy, as if to
make up for any little delays, that it completely
drowned the clatter of Stars and Garters' hoofs
as she cantered over the cobble-stones of the High
Street.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Another horseman.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Lawrence Lee, only halting to snatch
a meal by the way, and to give his horse half an
hour's rest, reached Stanstead Church, just as the
youngsters let loose from morning dame school
were pranking among the gravestones, and
plundering the hawthorn hedges.  Tired out, but
lighter of heart than he could remember for many
a long day, he threw them a gay quip as he passed.
Bang, clash, rattle, went the churchyard wicket,
away all over the dusty road the poor may
blossoms, scattered and trampled under ruthless
little feet all trotting after the big horse's legs.
And no marvel neither; for let alone the merry
jokes of Master Lee, who always was the most
popular creature in the world with the young fry
of the neighbourhood, there was a thing to be seen
popping its head in and out of the deep pocket of
his doublet in the most strange fashion.  Head,
forsooth! a bunch of brown satin ribbons you
mean, or some fairing of the sort for Mistress
Ruth Rumbold, that wobbled to and fro with the
horse's movements.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
"'Tis a dog."
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Naa, 'tes a dog, tell'ee," whispered a five-year-old
wiseacre under his breath.
</p>

<p>
"Dog!" contemptuously laughed a wise virgin
of six, whose canine circle of acquaintance was
limited to huge farm mastiffs and gypsy curs.
"'Tes a silk pincush'n for Madam Lee, cain't you
see the brown and whoite bows to the corners o't."
</p>

<p>
"Pincush'n! bows!  Thems its ears an' its oyes a
gogglin'.  Pincush'ns doesn't goggle their oyes; 'tes
a dog, ain't it, Marster Lee?"
</p>

<p>
"Something of the sort," answered Lee, carefully
drawing the little King Charles from his
snug hiding-place, and exhibiting its roly-poly
body to the public gaze; but the shrieks of
delight greeting its appearance, so startled its
unaccustomed ears, that terror got the better of
Master Médor's courtly breeding, and sent him
scuffling back into the recesses of his friend's
riding-coat; and amidst a general groan at this
disappointing man[oe]uvre, Lee ambled on at a good
round trot, which quickly brought him within
sight of the grass-grown broken tower tops of
Nether Hall.  It was now close upon mid-day,
and the sun shone hotly, so that the deserted look
of the meadows where the haymakers had just
commenced work would have occasioned their
young proprietor small surprise, even could his
preoccupied mind have spared the matter a
thought.  Just a day it was for creeping away
into the shade of the hedges, or of the alders
overhanging the cool water shallows, to munch
your rye-bread and bacon, and drink your draught
of milk or small-beer out of your old tin can;
and one or two old crippled men and women
seemed the only folks in the way to give the master
a welcome home.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A posse comitatus.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Eager to relieve the anxiety he felt his long
and unexpected absence must be causing his
mother, Lawrence Lee had no eyes for the strange
stares full of wonderment and suspicion the old
gaffers and goodies threw after him; but he was
startled out of himself as he reached the last field
skirting the lane which led to the house, by a
confused hubbub of voices and angry discussion,
as if the whole parish had collected between its
lofty hedgerows.  The spot, ordinarily so peaceful
and so silent, save for the singing of the birds in
the big elm boughs overhead, was now a veritable
Babel; and breaking through a gap in the hedge,
fresh made by the trampling of a hundred hobnailed
shoes, he leaped the intervening ditch, and
alighting in their very midst, demanded in
imperative tones, what they did there?
</p>

<p>
For one instant, all stood as if confounded by
his apparition.  A thunderbolt fallen among them
would have startled them less.  Here had they been
scouring the country pretty well since daybreak,
north, south, east, west, and all points of the
compass between, among Epping glades, along
Hainhault hedgerows, away over Amwell,
Hoddesdon, Wideford, Ware, Waltham&mdash;far and wide,
the hue and cry had gone.  Deep into oozing
ditches, and hollow tree trunks, and pigsties, and
barns, and farmhouse cellars, and gable roofs, and
canal barges, and river craft, pitchforks, and sticks,
and cudgels of all sorts and sizes had prodded and
poked in search of farmer Lawrence Lee.
</p>

<p>
"What is the meaning of this?" indignantly
demanded Lee, as half a dozen strapping fellows
clad in the local militia uniform broke through
the crowd of smock-frocks, and closed round him.
"Is this the way you do your duty, Master
Sergeant?" he went on addressing that officer, who
had seized his bridle-rein.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Arrested for murder.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Ay, it be, Master Cap'n," grinned the fellow&mdash;for
Lee was the head of their company&mdash;"an' a
moighty proper pretty way too.  You be our
prisoner!"
</p>

<p>
"Prisoner!"
</p>

<p>
"Oy, oy, it be all roight, ship-shape.  You be
arrested."
</p>

<p>
"On what charge?"
</p>

<p>
"That be no business o' yourn."
</p>

<p>
"The murder o' Sheriff Goodenough," shrieked
an open-mouthed matron.  "The murder o' Sheriff
Goodenough, Master Innocence.  Him as lies dead
in the Warder's Room at Master Rumbold's?"
</p>

<p>
"By whose charge?" said Lee, passing his hand
across his eyes, like a man striving to see the light.
</p>

<p>
"You want to be knowing more than's good
for you," sneeringly replied the sergeant; "'tis all
roight.  Him as asks no questions, woan't be telled
no lies.  I warrant ya 't be no use kickin'.
Eh&mdash;yow! yow! stand still, you brute," yelled the
brave Hector, as Lawrence's horse evinced a
decided disposition to make a trial of his heels,
and sent the by-standers to a safer distance.  Lee,
however, quieted the animal, and then with a
composure of manner that worked everybody up
to an unendurable pitch of exasperation, he again
demanded his accuser's name.
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Richard Rumsey," answered the spokesman,
thinking it wiser perhaps to comply.
</p>

<p>
"Very good," said Lawrence dismounting, and
consigning his horse to one of his own stablemen
who stood near.
</p>

<p>
"Come!  Quick march, cap'n," said the sergeant,
regaining all his wonted valour, as the
sound of the departing horse's hoofs grew fainter
and fainter.
</p>

<p>
"Where to?" said Lawrence, facing about.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
"To the King's Arms!"
</span>
</p>

<p>
"The King's Arms, to begin with, and then&mdash;"
the man chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"That will do," calmly said Lee.  "What do
you mean by this?" he added, a purple red flush
of wounded pride suffusing all his face, as a stout
cord was flung over his shoulders from behind,
and a dozen hands secured it.
</p>

<p>
"Only a little compliment we pay to plotters
and suchlike folk," laughed the sergeant.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mob law.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Lawrence was about to make a violent
resistance; but suddenly his face changed, a look of
deep humiliation came over it, and he stopped
short.  "Do I not deserve this?" he said to
himself, and then he submitted quietly; and as if he
were in his old position as leader of these men,
and not the led one, he turned and faced about
for the Rye; only delaying for a moment to charge
some of the terror-stricken women-servants of the
farm with a cheering message for his mother, and
to bid them conceal the truth from her, as up till
now they had contrived to do&mdash;"till he should
return," as he said, regardless of the mocking
gibes of the rabble, pressing upon all sides.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXX
<br><br>
A TRAVELLER FROM NEWMARKET.
</h3>

<p>
"This a fair scene," said the king to
himself, as between three and four o'clock
in the afternoon he reached the rising
ground which commanded the familiar
prospect of the square battlemented roof
and tall spiral chimney-shaft of the Rye House.
"I think," he pondered on, "if I were not king
of England, I would be a maltster, and live in
such a corner of it, as this Master Rumbold does,
without a care to fret me, and with one fair
daughter, and my honest friend Farmer Lee for
my nearest neighbour.  But yonder," continued
Charles, as his glance caught the gables of the
King's Arms, "lies our rendezvous.  Now, may
my luck be as good as Master Isaak Walton's, and
bring me as good a supper of fish out of yonder
little silver stream, as he used to find under the
old hostelry's roof.  'Tis quite certain at all events,"
he went on, smilingly to himself, as he caught
sight of the buxom figure of Mistress Sheppard,
who was standing at the porch expectantly,
shading her eyes with her hand as she looked up
the road, "that this present hostess of the King's
Arms, is as cleanly and handsome-looking as her
predecessor could be; and as to her civility, if
Master Lee's word is to be taken&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Pleasant quarters.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Bless the darling!" murmured Mistress Sheppard,
making a profound curtsey to the king, as
Stars and Garters stopped of her own sweet will
before the porch, and neighed a greeting.
</p>

<p>
"Pretty creature!" she murmured on under her
breath, hardly knowing whether the sight of her
favourite, or of her favourite's rider, more originated
the agreeable fluttering about her heart; for at the
first glimpse she had recognized the king; and
guessed at the consequent success of Lawrence
Lee's mission.  "Will your Majesty be pleased to
dismount?" she said in low glad tones, as she laid
her hand lightly on the mare's neck.
</p>

<p>
"Why, bless my soul!" ejaculated Sheppard,
who now made his appearance in the porch, to
receive the new-comer, and rubbing his eyes to
stare at the horse.  "Stars and Garters&mdash;as I'm
alive!"
</p>

<p>
"You're not alive, man.  You're asleep," laughed
his wife, a trifle nervously, and placing her ample
figure in such a position as to intercept his view
of the horse, as it disappeared under the ostler's
care in the direction of the stables.  "Stars and
Garters!  What next, I wonder?  'Tis all Stars
and Garters in thy sleepy eyes!  Come, stir about
man.  Waken up, and take his Ma&mdash;take this
good gentleman indoors, an' lay the table, while
I see about somethin' for him to eat."
</p>

<p>
"Not forgetting a trout.  Eh, Mistress?" called
the guest after her.
</p>

<p>
"Ay.  I'll warrant your&mdash;worship.  A right royal
one 'tis too," answered the beaming hostess.
</p>

<p>
"One would ha' guessed she'd bin' expectin' of
him," muttered Sheppard, still rubbing the mystification
out of his eyes, while he preceded his guest
to the inn parlour, "and him a moighty sort of a
favourite too.  Now, there's a many that comes
along, as she thinks naught o' puttin' off with chub;
nasty fork-boned watery skelintons o' things.  But
my foine old gentleman here, must be havin' his
trout, and his curtseys, and down bobbins into the
bargain."  And Master Sheppard, who, as luck
would have it, had been a bit put about all day
with one thing and another, having first rather
sulkily flicked a few stray crumbs with his
snow-white apron from the bright oaken table to the
floor, proceeded to lay the cloth.
</p>

<p>
"Any news stirring in these parts?" asked the
guest in careless tones, as he threw himself
comfortably among the cushions of a settle drawn up
in the deep bay of the window looking upon the
road.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A surly host.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Now there was a good deal of news stirring;
but Sheppard, contrary to his garrulous wont,
seemed in no mood to impart it; and he only
replied by a shrug of his lean shoulders, and a
shake of the head, casting at the same time
uneasy and sheepish glances towards a stout
broad-shouldered man, seated in the embrasure of a
distant window smoking an enormous Dutch pipe,
whose hat was drawn low down over his eyes, which
were apparently absorbed in gloomy contemplation
of the huge jack of ale on the table before him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Meaning words.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Be you from nor'ards, Master Traveller?" said
Sheppard to the new-comer, as if in haste to turn
the current of conversation.
</p>

<p>
"Cambridge," answered the guest, craning his
neck towards the window, as if he expected somebody.
</p>

<p>
"Eh! be you, now?" said Sheppard, rousing up
a little, and a gleam of intelligence breaking into
his eyes.  "Then I doubt you can tell me if 'tis
true that May Queen has beat Satan by ten paces,
as the talk goes she has?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite true."
</p>

<p>
"An' what," gleefully nodded Sheppard, "what's
your notions over Flatfoot?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! safe to win."
</p>

<p>
"The king's own horse, an't he?"
</p>

<p>
The traveller nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe as you've a score on her yourself?" said
Sheppard with a knowing wink.
</p>

<p>
"Rather a heavy one.  Yes," replied the
traveller, suppressing a faint sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well," consolingly said Sheppard.  "An'
you'll make a potful, depend upon't.  Trust Old
Rowley for tellin' good horseflesh from carrion."
</p>

<p>
"Ay.  As he's able to tell honest subjects from
crop-eared knaves," laughed the stranger, drawing
close up to the table, and pouring out a bumper
of ruby red wine from the tall silver-lipped flagon
which Mistress Sheppard had just brought in, and
placed at his elbow.  "Shall we drink his health,
friend?" he added, brimming another glass, and
pushing it toward Sheppard.
</p>

<p>
A more agonizing expression than the one breaking
on Sheppard's face at this challenge, it would
be impossible to conceive.  Half-way his trembling
fingers carried the goblet to his lips that quivered
with strange contortions; then as his oblique stolen
glances crossed those of the silent smoker,
uplifted towards the shadows cast by the ivy half
covering the lattice, his cheeks turned white as
his apron, and he set down the glass untasted.
</p>

<p>
"Come man! what ails you?" said the stranger,
looking up at the unhappy Sheppard, and then
not without a touch of suspicion at the flagon.
"Or is anything wrong with the wine?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no," gasped Sheppard, "it's very nice
wine indeed;" and he gazed at the contents of
his cup, with affectionate admiration.  "Very nice.
But I&mdash;I&mdash;I'm&mdash;ordered not&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;"  Then
he broke down hopelessly.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Dinner for a King.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Not to touch it, eh?" and laughing heartily at
his host's perturbation, the stranger turned his
attention to the trout which Mistress Sheppard was
now setting before him with her own fair hands.
"And who's your medical adviser?" he continued,
as he made a deep incision into the gleaming armour
of the fish.  "I' faith! if 'tis yonder gentleman,"
and he gave a half glance towards the silent
stranger, "I'd seek another opinion if I were you.
What is this?" he went on, turning to inspect the
contents of a little cruet-tray which Mistress
Sheppard was handing to him.  "Verjuice and vinegar!
Thanks, no.  I'll have none of them.  For though
'tis said they're good for the digestion, they
always spoil mine," and he pushed away his plate,
almost untasted, and his dark eyes wandered
towards the silent guest.  "What have you there?"
he went on, as Sheppard with vast pomp and
circumstance, placed on the table a large dish.
</p>

<p>
"Sirloin," answered Sheppard, flourishing off the
silver cover, huge as Mambrino's helmet.  "Sirloin&mdash;your
worship," he reiterated obsequiously, as if
he was anxious to patch up the appalling hole he
had just now made in his manners.  "Prime cut.
Fit for a king."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Dangerous names.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"I'll have none of it.  I cannot wait longer,"
said Charles, impatiently looking again towards
the window.  "I came here by appointment with
a&mdash;friend, who does not appear disposed to be
punctual.  And yet, by his own tale, he lives not
so far off from here.  His name is&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" whispered Mistress Sheppard in his
ear, as she bent to replace his plate with a clean
one.
</p>

<p>
"H'm&mdash;No matter," went on Charles.  "We&mdash;I
am not accustomed to be kept waiting," and he
rose, and took up his hat.  "Tell the young
gentleman when he does come, that he will find me at
Whitehall&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush&mdash;sh!" again whispered Mistress Sheppard.
</p>

<p>
"H'm&mdash;not far from the water stairs.  But he
knows my address.  So come, Master Landlord,
have with you, and find me a fresh horse.  And
pray be quick about it, for if I would sleep at home
to-night, I must be brisk.  I cry your pardon,
Mistress Sheppard.  You were about to speak?"
he added in courteous tones, as he perceived his
hostess smoothing her apron, and her lips opening
and shutting, and opening again.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A fair visitor.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"So please you, there is one," answered Mistress
Sheppard.  "Nay, names matter little.  One who
earnestly desires an audience&mdash;a word with you,
before you go.  A young girl&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Let her come in," said Charles with animation.

CHAPTER XXXI.
<br><br>
RUMSEY MEETS HIS MATCH.
</h3>

<p>
"Mistress, your servant," said the king,
his voice dropping to a gentle gravity,
as the door opened, and disclosed the
gray-clad figure of Ruth Rumbold.
"What can we do for you?" he added, striving
to conceal the curiosity he could not but feel at
sight of the pale face, and the sad wearied look of
the beautiful downcast eyes.  "Or do you perhaps
bring me the reckoning?" he went on, as,
encouraged by his kindly tones, she tendered him a
large folded paper which she carried in her hand,
making a profound curtsey as she did so, at the
same time lifting her eyes to his friendly gaze, so
that he could read in them of the heart too full
for words.
</p>

<p>
"Ods-fish, it must be something of a heavy
one!" he added laughingly, as he turned the paper
about, examining its seal; "but it bears no
superscription, Mistress&mdash;Mistress&mdash;are you not Mistress
Ruth Rumbold?"  She curtseyed again, "It bears
no superscription?" he reiterated, and hesitating
to break open the seal.
</p>

<p>
"It is meant for your&mdash;your&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Worship," prompted Mistress Sheppard.
</p>

<p>
"Your worship's reading," said Ruth.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p272"></a>
Then without more ado, Charles opened the paper.
</p>

<p>
"Why, what have we here?" he said, glancing
over its contents with awakened curiosity.  "'Tis
made out in two hands!  '<i>I, Thomas</i>'&mdash;who is it?
'<i>Thomas Good</i>'&mdash;I' faith! 'tis less like handwriting,
than as if a spider had dipped his legs in ink, and
then danced a coranto on this fair white paper
meadow.  Pray had the gentleman his wits
when he indited this?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, indeed," cried Ruth, "he had, but not
his strength&mdash;your worship.  He was dying."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I crave your pardon," said the king,
growing grave again, and dropping his gaze from
Ruth's troubled face, to the paper; "'<i>being now at
the point of death</i>.'  Ay, ay, I see now, I should
have read further, '<i>by the hand of the man
Richard</i>'&mdash;what's that noise?" he went on, breaking
off in his deciphering endeavours, as a distant
chorus of yells and shouts and hideous cat-calls
suddenly broke upon the drowsy afternoon silence.
"Your neighbourhood," he added with an amused
smile, as he turned to continue his task, "would
appear to be less peaceful than it looks.  '<i>The
man Richard</i>&mdash;'"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The strange guest speaks.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Maybe 'tis your friend come at last to keep his
appointment," said the stranger, whose eyes had for
many minutes past been fixed on Charles.  "Better
late than never, you know," he added, putting his
pipe back between his lips, which were curled
into an ugly leer; and thrusting both hands into
the pockets of his small clothes, he settled
himself to watch the approach of a dense motley
rabble enveloped in a cloud of dust, which
suddenly broke with a renewed outburst of uproar,
over the low wood garden-fence, trampling it
under foot, till it lay scattered in all directions.
On, on, tramp, tramp, surging to the very windows
it came, amidst shrieks and whoops, and cries
of "Shame! shame! give him a yard o' rope, fair
play!  God save the king!&mdash;The gallows tree's too
good for him!"&mdash;Tramp, tramp, fell the heavy tread
of hobnailed shoes, until the forest of pitchforks,
cudgels, rusty firearms, spades, spuds, rakes, and
every conceivable weapon and tool brandished
aloft by the strange crew fell apart, and disclosed
the cord-bound figure of Lawrence Lee.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The prisoner.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"What!" cried the king, starting in amazement.
"Master Lee?"
</p>

<p>
"And a right magnificent progress he appears
to have made," said the stranger, with an insolent
laugh, as he carefully laid aside his pipe and rose
from his seat.  "Ho! come, guards," he shouted
through the open window; "bring in your
prisoner;" and hustled forward along the broad
passage, despite the proddings and fisticuffs dealt
right and left by his guards, against whom Mistress
Sheppard seconded her indignant protests, by the
vigorous aid of her own hands and finger nails,
Lee, deprived of all power of helping himself,
stumbled head first into the presence of the king.
</p>

<p>
"What does this mean?" cried Charles, as Lee,
maintaining a stout resistance, succeeded for a
moment in elbowing off the worst of the press, and
hurrying forward, dropped, breathless and spent,
upon one knee at the king's feet.
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty," he began.
</p>

<p>
"The king?!!" broke in one universal shout of
amazement from all present, excepting from the
lips of Mistress Sheppard and Ruth Rumbold, and
then an awe-stricken silence fell.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me&mdash;" began the king.
</p>

<p>
"I can tell your Majesty but this," said Lee,
his voice falling clear and resonant through the
utter stillness, "that I have been arrested by the
order of the man who stands there, Richard Rumsey;
but on what charge, I wait for him to say."
</p>

<p>
"On the charge," said Rumsey, advancing from
the shadows, like some savage beast from its lair,
with an evil twitching of his lips, and a serpent-like
glitter in his cold eyes, which, however,
carefully eluded the gaze of all present&mdash;"the charge
of the murder of Sheriff Goodenough."
</p>

<p>
"What?!" shouted Lee, bounding to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Committed," calmly continued Rumsey, still
looking into space, "in the Warder's Room of
Master Rumbold's house yonder yesterday morning."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The witness.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Nay, that is false," broke in Ruth, "for it
wanted almost ten minutes of midnight.  The
clock had not struck."
</p>

<p>
"Girl!" cried Rumsey starting, and turning upon
her a face grown ghastly pale; but immediately
collecting himself he added, addressing the king,
with a baleful smile upon his lips, "Let it be
so, your M&mdash;&mdash;.  The young woman may be
right.  She is in Master Lee's confidence I doubt
not; and he has whispered the gentle secret of
his exploit to her.  Ten minutes to midnight it
might have been."
</p>

<p>
"Villain!" furiously burst forth Lee.
</p>

<p>
"And since he has imparted in sweet confidence
to this&mdash;in sooth I think she just now said
her name was&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The accuser.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Ruth Rumbold, yes," cried the girl in a loud
ringing voice.  "And 'tis you&mdash;you, Richard
Rumsey, are the murderer of Sheriff Goodenough!"
</p>

<p>
"You are certainly mighty wise, little mistress,"
he rejoined with a spasmodic twitch of his pallid
lips.  "Your Majesty," he went on, turning jauntily
to the king, and with a careless wave of his
hand towards Lee, "can see how the land lies
betwixt these two.  And this brave young
bloodsucker is indeed to be envied so fair a special
pleader.  But it won't do, my dear," he added,
addressing Ruth in jeering tones.  "'Tis too grave
a matter."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, truly," said the bewildered Charles, again
glancing over the paper in his hands.  "Grave
indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"Scoundrel! double-dyed villain!" exclaimed
Lee, writhing in his cords, and glaring at Rumsey.
"Is it not enough that already your soul is black
with its guilt, but you must accuse another of
your crime?"
</p>

<p>
"Words break no bones," coolly laughed Rumsey.
"If ever now," he went on, pointing at Lee's
bound hands, whose every vein stood out to bursting
in his struggles to get free, "these inconvenient
little knots should be loosed, you shall certainly
be set to rant it at Drury Lane playhouse.  You'd
make Manager Betterton's fortune in a week.  In
the meantime," he added, turning to the king,
"your Majesty sees before you the slayer of
Thomas Goodenough."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
For the defence.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay; he speaks truth at last!" cried Mistress
Sheppard, and dashing forward, and squaring
up to Rumsey, she shook her clenched fist in his
face.
</p>

<p>
"Woman!" he snarled, retreating a step, and
his ashen lips quivering apart, like a half-cowed
hyena's.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! woman me as much as you please," she
stormed on.  "That don't frighten me much, I
reckon.  Yes, yes, woman I am, and Ruth here has
told me all about it; and how the others being
gone away&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Others?" wonderingly interrupted the king.
"Gone away?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, for sure.  The other conspirators, your
Majesty&mdash;being gone down into the vaults with
Master Rumbold, to see the way they should
escape by, if&mdash;when&mdash;"  She hesitated a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Go on, my good woman.  I understand," said
the king, "when their purpose should be
accomplished."
</p>

<p>
"And they left Master Goodenough, who had
fallen asleep in the window, alone with this
Rumsey here; and Master Goodenough, who was not
for&mdash;for your Majesty being murdered, but only
for being made away with like, across the water&mdash;being
presently wakened up, picked a quarrel with
this fellow&mdash;that is, this fellow, who was all for
hacking down your Majesty and his grace of York
yonder in the lane, like any butcher's oxen, picked
it with him, and&mdash;Come, Ruth, child;" and seizing
Ruth by the arm, Mistress Sheppard dragged her
forward.  "Those were his words.  Tell the king
how those were his words."
</p>

<p>
"Lies!" hissed Rumsey through his livid lips.
"Let her bring her witnesses.  Just a string of
lies!"
</p>

<p>
"Those are in thy foul mouth," retorted Mistress
Sheppard.  "Not in this gentle child's, who
found courage, Heaven helping her, for the king's
sake, to make herself certain of all your evil minds
were hatchin'; and then spared not what was best
and dearest to her, so only that the king should
be apprised of your villainy.  Oh, I trow they'll be
well mated man an' wife," murmured on Mistress
Sheppard, gazing with proud tears in her eager
eyes, from Ruth to Lawrence Lee, "when please
old Time's good leisure, he shall make her a trifle
older."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A parenthesis.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Keep to the point, dear Mistress Sheppard,"
said Lawrence, flushing a little.
</p>

<p>
"An' what am I doin', if I aren't keepin' to't?"
demanded she.  "Don't I say that she spared not
even you, Lawrence Lee, to the perilsome journey
to Newmarket? and didn't you right willingly
mind her biddin'?  Oh, I'll warrant me, little
Ruth has told me all; and who but me was't, that
girthed Stars and Garters, not waitin' to
untie&mdash;savin' your Majesty's sacred presence&mdash;to untie
my nightcap, and bid ye God-speed, and sent ye
both gallopin' off together?"
</p>

<p>
"This is a strange tale," said the king, as
Mistress Sheppard paused for lack of breath.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The evidence.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Ay, 'tis indeed," she went on, "and Mistress
Ruth has eyes an' ears, an' uses 'em to better
purpose than some folks I know"&mdash;and she threw
a significant glance at her bewildered better
half&mdash;"as can only stand gaffin' and gawmin' at a body.
An' she used 'em to bestest purpose of all, that
moment when she hided, poor lamb, inside o'
yonder panel that looks into the Warder's Room,
an' saw you, Richard Rumsey, commit your foul
deed.  And so for your witness, if you want one,
why here she stands."
</p>

<p>
"Unbind this young man's arms," said the king.
</p>

<p>
Rumsey started forward with looks of well-feigned
concern.  "Is your Majesty mad?" he
said protestingly.  "'Tis indeed too venturesome&mdash;too
foolhardy, if I may say so.  This fellow&mdash;taken
red-handed&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We are surety for his not running away,"
interrupted the king with a faint smile.
</p>

<p>
"Shall she tell more?" went on Mistress Sheppard,
looking on with triumphant satisfaction,
while the king's commands were being obeyed.
"Do you want to know how like the Lord's own
blessed Bible Samaritan this child tended the
poor bleeding sinful soul, an' strove to save his
poor body; but Heaven would not have it so, an'
called him to his account&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Does your Majesty," loftily broke in Rumsey,
"accept the testimony of this ranting virago, and
this puling girl, or the word of a soldier?"
</p>

<p>
"He can take it, or leave it," cried Mistress
Sheppard, throwing all her court manners to the
winds, "like pigs leave pearls for offal.  The
witness of living truth," she went on in slower and
solemn tones, "and of loyal hearts, is no thing to
be despised.  But the testimony of the dead is
mightier than the angel's last trumpet; and that
looks his Majesty in the face;" and Mistress
Sheppard pointed to the paper in the king's hands.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The tables turned.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"It is enough," said Charles, gazing with
emotion on the poor faint signature of the dying
man's hand, and the somewhat tremulous but
clerkly little characters beneath it.  "Richard
Goodenough being dead, yet speaketh.  Arrest
that traitor!" and he pointed to Rumsey.
</p>

<p>
Like a wild beast at bay, the guilty wretch
glared round him.  All chance of escape was
worse than hopeless; and the guard which now
left Lawrence Lee a free man, and hastened to
surround their new prisoner, had apparently an easy
task in securing him.  Ere, however, they could
touch him, he plunged his hand into his breast,
and with a heavy, but lightning-quick sideways
lurch, eluded the grasp of his captors, and
breaking into a low rageful howl stumbled forward
within a couple of paces of the king.  "So then!"
he cried with an imprecation, snatching his hidden
hand from the bosom of his doublet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Rumsey's last attempt.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Time only to see that it clutches some gleaming
weapon which he turns with a savage thrust
upon the king's breast,&mdash;time only for a moment
of dumb stricken horror instantly broken by shrieks
and cries mingling with the deafening report of a
pistol, whose smoke as it clears in thin bluish
vapour reveals Rumsey prostrate at the king's
feet beneath the grip of Lawrence Lee, the fingers
of the would-be regicide's right hand still grasping
the pistol, whose muzzle points straight upward
to the broad beam overhead, shattered and charred,
and riddled with its discharged contents!

  "So, bring us to our palace; where we'll show<br>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
One bright June morning, a few weeks
after the events recorded in this little
chronicle, the large audience chamber
of the palace of Whitehall is thronged
with a brilliant company, in whose midst are
seated King Charles and his Queen.  With curious
eager glances the fine lords and ladies jostle each
other to obtain a closer view of the dark-eyed
handsome young fellow, and the girl standing
beside him, apparently some few years his junior,
with whom their majesties are absorbed in
conversation.
</p>

<p>
The young man's eyes, when he can spare
them from the queen, turn admiringly on his
companion, around whose slender neck, white as
alabaster, except indeed where the saucy sun
has just bestowed his touches of tan upon it&mdash;his
majesty has just cast a chain of exquisitely
wrought gold, from which hangs a double pendant,
set with diamonds encircling the miniatures
of himself and Queen Catharine.  "'Tis a souvenir
of our regard and affection," the king is saying.
"Requital for your noble service, gold nor
diamonds cannot make.  These gems are but poor
shadows of truth and fealty like yours, fair
Mistress Ruth."
</p>

<p>
He paused, he had been about to institute some
worn-out comparison between the beautiful jewels
and Ruth's eyes, but a look from the queen
checked him, she saw those eyes were too brimful
of tears for any trifling, and as they welled
over, dropping fast upon the basket on her arm,
she made an attempt to speak.  "This&mdash;" she
faltered, slowly drawing down the handles over
her arms.
</p>

<p>
"Ay?" said the king graciously, as he looked
with rather expectant eyes at the basket.  Could
it be a present of eggs or cream or such like, from
the farm?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A converted courtier.
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Médor!" he exclaimed as he lifted the lid,
and the snubby muzzle, and two velvet brown
eyes of the little dog peered forth.  "Poor Médor!
Ods-fish! we had been near forgetting thee
altogether!"  Notwithstanding which piece of
self-confessed royal shortcoming, the small creature
bestowed a lick or two on his master's hands;
though it was a trifle carelessly, and he set up
a whine, and vigorous efforts to wriggle back into
Ruth's arms.
</p>

<p>
"Your kindness in this instance has been very
cruel, Mistress Ruth," smiled the king, as he let
the little creature have its way.  "You have
given him such hospitable entertainment since he
and I parted company in the burning room at
Newmarket, that now he is loth to be separated
from you.  Médor loves you."
</p>

<p>
Nothing could be more clear than that the
dog's sentiments were fully reciprocated, judging
from Ruth's caress, and the wistful look her eyes
bestowed on the little creature.
</p>

<p>
"Not better than she loves Médor," said Lawrence.
</p>

<p>
"Say you so?  Why then, 'twould be the
breaking of two hearts to part them!  A crime no
conscience could endure," cried the king.  "Say,
fair Mistress, will you keep the little jackanapes
for your own?"
</p>

<p>
Would she?  Would she not?  Well, as Maudlin
always would have it, Ruth was a strange
incomprehensible creature; and if pleasure shone in her
face at the gift of that costly carkanet, what
comparison did that bear to the content brightening
it, as she clasped Médor her own, her very
own, in her arms!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Marriage bells.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Benefits of a more substantial sort were
conferred on Lawrence Lee; and the estate of Nether
Hall was widened by many a broad acre, so that
Farmer Lee came to be accounted one of the
wealthiest landowners of the shire, and the
marvel of it was, that few begrudged him this worldly
good fortune; though it would be too much to
say none envied his lot, when one fine morning
a year or two later, old Stanstead Church bells
rang a joyous peal, as he led his wife Ruth along
the flower-strewn way to her new home.
</p>

<p>
Something, nay very much of the old content
shines again, now at last in Ruth's face; though
its placid light-hearted look is gone for ever, and
the shadow of past griefs will linger on it, till,
herself an aged woman, they will lay her to
her rest, to wait the time when all shadows flee
away.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Patriots and plotters.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Still, very bright and blessed was Ruth's future,
with the love of Madam Lee, warm and deep
as own mother's love could be; and the devotion
of her husband, and the music of small voices
that by and by began to ring about the old house,
and the mysterious alleys of the hornbeam maze;
but no happiness could ever efface for her the
memory of her father's fate.
</p>

<p>
Stern and implacable, yielding only to the
gentler side of his nature, to stifle it down again,
he had deeply loved Ruth, and been loved by
her with a child's heart-felt affection.  Honest in
his convictions, loyal to his leader the famous
Argyle, bravely as he had lived, Richard Rumbold,
maimed and tortured by his captors, died
an ignominious death at the Market Cross at
Edinburgh, two years after the exposure of the
Rye House Plot.
</p>

<p>
Cruel as these tidings of his end were, it was
rendered ten times crueller by the thought of
all those noble hearts that perished for the cause
which had exasperated more desperate, and less
disciplined minds to devise the hideous lengths of
bloodshed and assassination; bringing all alike to
the scaffold; patriot and lofty spirits like Sydney
and Russel, grovelling, revengeful self-seekers like
so many of the plotters.  Few escaping with their
lives, excepting such scum as those who turned
king's evidence like Richard Rumsey, and bought
their evil breath at the price of their old
hand-in-glove comrades' death.

Upon all this, Ruth in the coming years would
oftentimes sit and ponder.  Ardent, unshaken
little Stuart royalist as she remained to her latest
day, and as Master Lawrence under her good
guidance came to be, it is doubtful whether either
was ever brought to declare with good Madam
Lee, that "the king could do no wrong."  That
question, however, they left uncontested, and,
content with trying to do as little of it as possible
themselves, did so much good as to call down
upon their heads in life and in death the blessings
of all the country side.

The grandfather's part which the roll of time
brought into request at Nether Hall, was
excellently represented by good old bachelor Master
Alworth, who was its frequent guest, and of
the many tales he used to tell the little ones,
they liked very much that one of the brave, dear,
real grandfather who died fighting for the king on
Worcester field.

Of old Maudlin, what more can be said than
that she passed her uneventful later years in
the snug ingle nook at Nether Hall, made much
of by every member of the establishment.

Adam Lockit, being of another turn of mind,
declined to forsake his quarters in the gatehouse.
New masters of the old mansion might come and
they might go.  Maltster or magnifico, peasant or
peer, but monarch of his trophy-hung little domain
he remained; bequeathing it, when at last he went
the way of all flesh, with his well-seasoned tales
of flood and field, and hobgoblinry, to Barnaby
Diggles, who superadded in fair writing (an
accomplishment, by the way, for which he was beholden
to his old master's daughter), that tradition of his
own times, of the famous plot and conspiracy
against his gracious majesty King Charles the
Second&mdash;known as the Rye House Plot&mdash;and
whose valuable assistance towards the putting
together of this present record, it well behoves
this chronicler gratefully to recognize.

Need it be added that the substantial marks of
the king's gratitude which were bestowed on the
hostess of the King's Arms, entirely converted
Master Sheppard to his wife's way of thinking? and
they subsided into the happiest peacefullest pair
you could find in Hertfordshire; but then Master
Sheppard never again put his fingers in what his
wife called "pies that weren't baked for his
eatin';" and when sea-coal was wanted for the
King's Arms' hearth-places, honest sea-coal it
might be, but Mistress Sheppard took good care it
should be conveyed overland in a proper decent
wagon; and always stood by in person, to count
the sacks, and to see to the bottom of them too.

As to oysters, she steadily set her face against
the things, and refused ever again to admit the
ghost of a shell of one inside her doors.  "If chub
and barbel and trout&mdash;trout such as his sacred
majesty King Charles, not to speak of the
renowned Master Isaak Walton before him, had
partaken of under her roof, was not good enough
for common wayfarin' folks, why, let 'em go
farther," she said, "an' fare worse."

Spiked atop of the spiral chimney of the
gatehouse, there hung for many a year the ghastly
decapitated head of one of the arch conspirators,
but long ago it crumbled to nothingness, and
no blot now mars the scene that is as goodly and
fair as old England has to show.  Side by side in
sweet converse, like old friends, the two rivers
still wander on amid the green pastures.  Still
round about, and in and out of the red battlemented
walls, the rooks flit, and caw their never-ending
chorus, and the tall trees wave their long
arms day and night, and whisper to those who
list to hear it, the story of the Old Rye House.
